/*
	In contrast to the INNER JOIN, the order of the tables plays an important role in the LEFT JOIN, 
	and the results may be completely different if the order changes in your SQL query. 

	When determining the order of tables in a LEFT JOIN, the general rule is to start with the 
	table from which you want to keep all the records in the final result.

	Also, keep in mind that a LEFT JOIN cascades to all joins in a query. 
	If you use a LEFT JOIN, often the subsequent tables should also be left-joined. 
	An INNER JOIN will drop records not found on both sides of the join, and you might lose 
	all the records you want to keep-- the reason for using a LEFT JOIN instead of the 
	usual INNER JOIN in the first place.
