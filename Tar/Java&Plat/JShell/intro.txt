JShell implements:

    read-evaluate-print loop (REPL)

    using this mechanism,

        we are initially prompted to enter a fragment of code

        the fragment is then read and evaluated

        next JShell displays output related to the code

            such as the output produced by a 'println()' statement

            the result of the expression, or the current value of a variable

        finally JShell then prompts for the next piece of code
