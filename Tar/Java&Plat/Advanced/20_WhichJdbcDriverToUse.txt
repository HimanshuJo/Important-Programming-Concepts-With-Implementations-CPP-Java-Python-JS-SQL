Suppose in my project I'm using just only one database:

    example: Oracle database

    here we're not going to change our database at all, therefore
        highly recommended to go for 'Type-4' driver

    -------

    best example:

        Suppose we've a standalone application (applications which are running on single machine)
            or small-scale web applications

        for these types of projects, type-4 driver is the best suitable driver

-------

Suppose I'm working on very big enterprise application (e.g. a mobile application)
    in that lakhs of customers will be there

    Customers information I've to store in the Oracle database

        however, for the billing and the call information, I've to store them in the
            MySql database

    Hence, in this case we're using multiple databases, therefore here it is not recommended
        to use Type-4 driver.

        It is highly recommended to use Type-3 driver

            Because in the type-3 driver, the biggest advantage is:

                for all the databases only one driver is enough

                As type-3 driver is database-independent driver

    -------

    So, it doesn't matter how many databases we use, only one type-3 driver is required

        e.g. large scale web application or
             enterprise applications
