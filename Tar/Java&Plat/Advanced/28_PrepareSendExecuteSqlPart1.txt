As a part of standard steps to develop an application, there are three steps:

    1. Load and register driver class

    2. Establish connection between Java application and database

    3. To send our SQL query some vehicles must be required

        so creation of statement object

    4. Prepare my SQL query and I've to send it to the database

        Prepare, Send and Execute SQL query

-------

Type of SQl commands:

    1. DDL (Data Definition Language) Commands

        e.g. create table, alter table, drop table etc.

    2. DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands

        e.g. insert, delete, update

    3. DQL (Data Query Language) commands

        e.g. select

    4. DCL (Data Control language) commands

        e.g. alter password, grant access etc.

    5. Data Administration commands

        start audit

        stop audit

        ...

    6. Transaction control commands

        commit, rollback, savepoint etc.

-------

being Java developer I require only two types of commands

    Select queries

        these are basically DQL

            e.g. select * from employees;

    Non-select queries

        insert, delete, update etc.

-------

Basic SQL commands:

    1. To create a table

        // to create a table what columns I want:

            movie number, movie name, hero, heroine

        create table movies(movie_number number, movie_name varchar2(10),
            hero varchar2(10), heroine varchar2(10))

    2. To delete/drop a table

        drop table movies;

    3. To insert rows into table

        insert into movies values(1, 'Bahubali', 'Prabhas', 'Anushka');

    4. To update data in the database

        update movies set heroine='Tamannah' where movie_number=1; or movie_name='Bahubali';

    5. To delete a row from the database

        delete from movies where movie_number=2;

    6. To select data

        select * from movies;
