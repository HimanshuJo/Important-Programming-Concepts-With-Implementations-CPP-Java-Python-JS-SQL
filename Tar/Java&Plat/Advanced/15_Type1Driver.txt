Workflow:

    Java Application  --> Type-1 Driver  --> ODBC Driver  --> Database
    (JDBC)            <--                <--              <--

-------

Also known as JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver or Bridge Driver

This driver is provided by Sun Micro-systems as the part of JDK

Internally that driver will take support of ODBC driver to communicate with the database

Type-1 driver connects JDBC calls into the ODBC calls and 
    ODBC drivers connects ODBC calls to the database specific calls

Hence, type-1 Driver acts as a bridge between JDBC and ODBC

-------

Advantages:

    It is very easy to use and maintain

    We are not required to install it as it's available as a part of JDK

    Type-1 driver won't communicate with the database directly, hence it is
        database independence driver.

        Because of this migrating from one database to another database will become easy

-------

Limitations:

    It's a slowest driver among all the drivers (semi-driver), because first it'll convert
        JDBC calls into the ODBC calls and ODBC driver connects ODBC into the database specific
        calls

    This driver internally depends on ODBC drivers, which internally works on the Windows machine,
        hence type-1 driver is platform dependent driver

    No support from JDK 1.8 version onwards

-------

** Because of above limitations it is not recommended to use Type-1 driver

    It's a history
