Basic concepts of JDBC Application:

    Driver  --> Translator

    Connection  --> Road

    Statement  --> Vehicle

    ResultSet  --> Box

-------

Driver:

    To convert Java Application calls into database specific calls, database specific calls into Java calls,
        some translator must be required which is nothing but driver

-------

Connection:

    Java Application wants to communicate with the database, for that some network socket is required, which is
        nothing but connection object

-------

Statement:

    To send our sql query from Java application to the database, and to bring results from database to
        Java application, some vehicle must be required.

    That vehicle is nothing but statement

-------

ResultSet:

    After executing our sql query, database engine will place the results inside a box
        that box in itself is nothing but resultSet

-------

Steps to develop JDBC application:

    1. Load and Register driver

    2. Establish connection between Java application and database

    3. Creation of Statement Object

    4. Send and Execute SQL query

    5. Process result from resultSet

    6. Close connection

-------

Example:

    import java.sql.*;

    class JDBCDemo
    {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
        {
            Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver");  // Class.forName is used to load any Java class
            Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
            Statement st = con.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * from employees");
            while(rs.next())
            {
                System.out.println(rs.getInt(1) + "..." + rs.getString(2) + "..." + rs.getDouble(3)
                    + "..." + rs.getString(4));
            }
            con.close();
        }
    }
