Property: Conversion

    Type-1:

        From JDBC calls to ODBC calls

    Type-2:

        From JDBC calls to native library calls

    Type-3:

        From JDBC calls to middleware server specific calls

    Type-4:

        From JDBC calls to database specific calls

-------

Property: Implemented in

    Type-1:

        Only in Java (it is coming as a part of JDK)

    Type-2:

        Java + native languages

    Type-3:

        Only in Java

    Type-4:

        Only in Java

-------

Property: Architecture

    Type-1:

        2-tier

    Type-2:

        2-tier

    Type-3:

        3-tier

    Type-4:

        2-tier

-------

Property: is it platform independent or platform dependent

    Type-1:

        platform dependent

            as it internally depends on ODBC driver

            ODBC driver concept is applicable only for Windows machines

    Type-2:

        platform dependent

            as it internally uses some native libraries (implemented in C or C++)

    Type-3:

        platform independent (completely developed in Java)

    Type-4:

        platform independent (completely developed in Java)

-------

Property: database dependent or database independent

    Type-1:

        database independent

            as it never communicates directly with the database

                internally it is communicating to the database via ODBC driver

    Type-2:

        database dependent

            as it internally uses database specific native libraries

    Type-3:

        database independent

            as it never communicates with the database directly

                internally my middleware server is going to take care the communication

    Type-4:

        database dependent

            it is communicating directly with the database

-------

Property: thin or thick

    Type-1:

        thick

    Type-2:

        thick

    Type-3:

        thick

    Type-4:

        thin

            as it communicates directly with the database without taking support
                of any other extra component

-------

Property: also known as

    Type-1:

        JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver (or) Bridge Driver

    Type-2:

        Native API -  partly JAVA Driver (or)

            Native Driver

    Type-3:

        All Java Net protocol driver (or)
            Network protocol driver (or)
            middleware driver

    Type-4:

        All Java Native protocol driver (or)
            Pure Java Driver (or)
            Thin Driver
