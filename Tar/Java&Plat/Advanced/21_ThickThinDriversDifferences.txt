Thin Driver:

    Type-4 driver is called think driver

------

Thick Driver:

    Type-1, Type-2, Types-3 drivers are called thick drivers

-------

To communicate with the database, if a driver requires some extra component

    such type of drivers are called thick-drivers

    -------

    In case of type-1 driver:

        it internally depends on ODBC driver

            with the help of ODBC driver it can communicate with the database

            suppose ODBC driver is not there, then type-1 driver can't work
    -------

    In case of type-2 driver:

        to communicate with the database, type-2 driver requires compulsory
            database vendor provided native libraries should be present in the
            client machine

    -------

    In case of type-3 driver:

        to communicate with the database, compulsory middle-ware server must be there

    -------

    Therefore, if a driver software require some extra component to communicate with the database
        such type of database are called thick drivers

-------

In case of type-4 driver, it won't require any extra components

    directly it can communicate with the database

    -------

    so if a driver doesn't require any extra component to communicate with the database, such type
        of databases are called thin drivers
