Difference between ODBC and JDBC:

    ODBC:

        Stands for Open Database Connectivity

        Introduced by Microsoft in 1992

        It can be used for any language like Python, C++, Java etc.

        We can use ODBC only for windows platform

        Mostly ODBC drivers are developed in native language like C/C++

        For Java application, it is not recommended to use ODBC because performance will be
            down due to internal conversions and application will become platform dependent

    JDBC:

        Stands for Java Database Connectivity

        Introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1997

        We can use JDBC only for Java language

        Mostly JDBC drivers are developed in Java

        For Java application, it is highly recommended to use JDBC because
            no performance and platform dependent problems
