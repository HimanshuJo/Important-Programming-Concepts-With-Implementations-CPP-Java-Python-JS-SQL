With Core Java we can develop only standalone applications

    These types of application are running on single machine (or computer)

    There are two types of stand-alone applications (desktop applications):

        1. GUI Based applications

        2. CUI Based applications (Console Applications)

            From the command prompt whatever we are executing

                e.g. java test.java

-------

In Java if we want to develop web applications:

    then we should go for the following technologies:

        1. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

        2. Servlets

        3. JSPs

-------

JSP:

    Suppose we have a website, where we have a login page, welcome page, error credentials page etc.

        so all the pages which the end user is able to see, are by default considered as

            View Component (contains presentation logic)

        In Java if we want to develop such type of view components, then we should go for JSP

            JSP (Java Server Pages)  --> meant for presentation logic

            so in essence in a Java web application we will have different web pages such as:

                login.jsp
                index.jsp
                error.jsp
                ...

-------

Servlet:

    Whenever we provide login credentials to a website,

        in the background the authentication and verification is done; the steps basically involves:

            - read data

            - compare data with the database values

                - if valid

                    - perform user's operation

                - else

                    - display error page

        so in essence a web component is processing our request

            the component which is working internally to process our request is called Servlet

            therefore, wherever processing logic is required better to go for Servlet

        sometimes servlet can take help from normal Java classes for business logic

            those java classes are known as 'Model Components'

-------

JDBC:

    Sometimes Servlet is required to communicate with the database

        or a Java component is required to communicate with the database

            so if we want to communicate with the database from Java application

                then we should go for JDBC
