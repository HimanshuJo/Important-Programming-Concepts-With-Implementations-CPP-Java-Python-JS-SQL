What is JDBC:

    It is a technology which can be used to communicate with database from Java Application

    -------

    Example:

        Suppose we have a java Application that wants to communicate with a database

            then JDBC will act as a middle man to do the communication between the
                java application and the database

    JDBC is also a part of Java SE

    It is also a specification or guidelines defined by Java vendor (Oracle Corporation)

        The implementation for the same is provided by Database vendor (e.g. MySQL, Postgres etc.)

            The database provided implementation is called Driver Software

-------

JDBC features:

    1. It is a standard API

        It is never going to change database to database

        e.g. If we use an Oracle database, for that

                Connection, Statement, ResultSet is same

            If we use MySQL database, for that also

                Connection, Statement, ResultSet is same

        Connection, Statement, ResultSet --> these database related words are same for any database

        -------

        Once I write a JDBC application for one database (e.g. MySQL), I can very easily (without rewriting
            the same application) the same application I can use for another database also

        -------

        Therefore JDBC is a database independent API

    2. To do the communication between a Java Application and a database

        driver software is required

            Database vendor is responsible for providing that driver software

            Most of the driver softwares or most of the drivers are developed by using Java language only

        -------

        So this JDBC driver has certain advantages:

            a. It is database independent technology

            b. It is platform independent technology

    3. Basic database operations such as CRUD (Create data or insert operation, Retrieve or read also known as select
        , Update, Delete)

        can be performed very easily by using JDBC API's
