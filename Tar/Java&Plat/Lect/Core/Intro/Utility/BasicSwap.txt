Method 1:

	Here's a method to swap two variables in java in just one line using bitwise XOR(^) operator.

	class Swap
	{
	   public static void main (String[] args)
	   {
	      int x = 5, y = 10;
	      x = x ^ y ^ (y = x);
	      
	      System.out.println("New values of x and y are "+ x + ", " + y);
	   }
	} 

	Output:

	New values of x and y are 10, 5

-------

Method 2:

	Use this one-liner for any primitive number class including double and float:

	a += (b - (b = a));

	For example:

	double a = 1.41;
	double b = 0;
	a += (b - (b = a));
	System.out.println("a = " + a + ", b = " + b);

	Output is a = 0.0, b = 1.41

Info:

	There are no pointers in Java

	However, every variable that contains an object is a reference to that object
