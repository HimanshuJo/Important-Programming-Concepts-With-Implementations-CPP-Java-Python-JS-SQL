|= is a bitwise-OR-assignment operator.

	It takes the current value of the LHS, bitwise-ors the RHS, and assigns the value back to the LHS 
		(in a similar fashion to += does with addition).

-------

For example:

	foo = 32;   // 32 =      0b00100000

	bar = 9;    //  9 =      0b00001001

	baz = 10;   // 10 =      0b00001010

	foo |= bar; // 32 | 9  = 0b00101001 = 41
	            // now foo = 41
	            
	foo |= baz; // 41 | 10 = 0b00101011 = 43
	            // now foo = 43
