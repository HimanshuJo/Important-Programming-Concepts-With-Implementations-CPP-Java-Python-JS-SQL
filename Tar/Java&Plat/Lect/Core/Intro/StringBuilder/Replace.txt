The replace(int start, int end, String str) method of StringBuilder class
    is used to replace the characters in a substring of this sequence with characters
    in the specified String.

    The substring begins at the specified index start and extends to the character at index end – 1
        or to the end of the sequence if no such character exists.

    At first, the characters of substring are removed and the string passed as parameters are
        inserted in place of those characters.

    -------

    Syntax:

        public StringBuilder replace?(int start, int end, String str)

    Parameters:

        This method accepts three parameters:

        start – Integer type value which refers to the starting index.
        end – Integer type value which refers to the ending index.
        str – String type value which refer to the String that will replace previous contents.

    Exception:

        If the start is negative, greater than length(), or greater than end then

        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder("WelcomeGeeks");

        System.out.println("String = " + str.toString());

        // replace Character from index 1 to 7 by "e are "
