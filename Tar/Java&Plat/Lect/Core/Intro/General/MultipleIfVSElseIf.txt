Snippet 1:

    int x = getVal();

    if (x == 0) {
        // something
        x == 1;
    } else if (x == 1) {
        // something else
    }

-------

Snippet 2:

    int x = getVal();

    if (x == 0) {
        // something
        x == 1;
    }
    if (x == 1) {
        // something
    }

-------

In the first case, only one of "Something" or "Something else" will occur

In the second case, due to the side effects of the first block, the condition in the second
    block will also be true

Snippet 3:

    int x = getVal();

    if (x < 10) {
        // something
        x == 1;
    } else if (x < 100) {
        // do something else
    } else if ( x < 1000) {
        // do some more thing
    }

    // here if we don't use the 'else' clause, then as soon as one of the condition has matched,
        the rest will too

-------

If we have multiple 'if' blocks then each will run independently

However, in the 'if', 'else if' block, the 'else if' block is only executed if the previous
    'if' condition has failed
