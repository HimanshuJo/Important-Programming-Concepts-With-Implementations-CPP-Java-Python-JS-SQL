JUnit

    is an open source testing framework for Java

    It is important for test-driven development

    It is also considered as an instance of XUnit architecture

    It is used for testing a small chunk of code or a unit

    -------

    JUnit is used to verify a small chunk of code by creating a path, function or a method

    JUnit basically promotes the idea of 'test first' and 'code later'

-------

Advantages of JUnit:

    It is one of the best testing framework that can be selected for an efficient testing process

    More Application Developer IDEs includes JUnit

    It also provides an AWT and Swing-based graphical test reporting mechanism

    JUnit also provides a text-based command line

    The open source community has extended JUnit by implementing a JUnitEE test framework that
        enables it to test within the application server's container

    A benchmark for testing in Java programming language

-------

Features:

    JUnit test allows you to write codes faster, which increases quality

    It is elegantly simple

    It provides annotations to identify test methods

    It provides test runners for running the tests

    Tests can be run automatically

    Tests can be organized into test suites

-------

The JUnit framework:

    JUnit is a 'Regression Testing Framework' which is used to implement unit testing in Java

    This framework allows quick and easy generation of test data and test cases

    -------

    Major features of JUnit test framework:

        1. Test fixtures

            They ensures that there is a well-known and fixed environment in which tests are run
                so that results are repeatable

            A fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects which is used as a baseline for running
                the test cases

            Two methods:

                setUp()

                    This method is run before the test invocation

                    The annotation @before is used in this case

                tearDown()

                    Here @after annotation is used

        2. Test suites

            If we want to execute multiple test cases in a specific order, it can be done by combining
                all the test cases in a single origin.

                This origin is called the 'test suites'

            To run the test suites we need to annotate the class using

                    @Runwith

                    @SuiteClasses

        3. Test runners

            The test runner is used to execute the test cases

            JUnit provides a tool for the execution of the test cases

            'JUnitCore' class is used in order to execute the tests

            'runClasses' method is used to run one or several test cases

                The return type of this method is the result object that is used to access information
                    about the tests

        4. JUnit classes

            JUnit classes are used in writing and testing JUnits
