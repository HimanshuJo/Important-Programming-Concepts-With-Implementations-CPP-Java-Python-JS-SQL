A JSP file is a server-generated web page.

It is similar to an .ASP or .PHP file, but contains Java code instead of ActiveX or PHP.

The code is parsed by the web server, which generates HTML that is sent to the user's computer.

-------

Since the Java code is parsed on the web server, the end user never sees the JSP code,
    but only the HTML generated by the Java code in the page.

    JSP pages can be edited using a web development program or basic text editor.

-------

Parsing:

    resolve (a sentence) into its component parts and describe their syntactic roles.

    analyse (a string or text) into logical syntactic components.
