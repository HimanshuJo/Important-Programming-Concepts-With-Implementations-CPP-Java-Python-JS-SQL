 In Synchronization:

    if we are executing something then we need to wait for it to finish before
        moving to the another task.

    Collection classes are not synchronized by default

        The collection object is mutable that means once creating the object and that
            object is calling two threads at a time but one thread is changing the value of the
            object then it can be effected by another object.

        Hence, it is not thread safe

    We can explicitly synchronized collection using static method

        java.util.Collections.synchronozedCollection(Collection<T> c)

-------

Synchronized basically means:

    that only one thread can access methods of that particular class at any given time.

    'StringBuffer' is an example of a synchronized class.

    A Synchronized class is a thread-safe class.

-------

Non-Synchronized means that two or more threads can access the methods of that particular class
    at any given time.

    'StringBuilder' is an example of a non-synchronized class.

    Generally, a non-synchronized class is not thread-safe. (but some non-synchronized classes are thread-safe)
