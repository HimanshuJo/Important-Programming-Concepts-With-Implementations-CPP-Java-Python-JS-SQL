num += 1 is rather equivalent to ++num.

All those expressions (num += 1, num++ and ++num) increment the value of num by one,
    but the value of num++ is the value num had before it got incremented.

Illustration:

int a = 0;
int b = a++; // now b == 0 and a == 1
int c = ++a; // now c == 2 and a == 2
int d = (a += 1); // now d == 3 and a == 3

-------

prefix and postfix operations are perfect candidates for exam questions.

a = 0;
b = a++;  // use the value and then increment --> a: 1, b: 0

a = 0;
b = ++a;  // increment and then use the value --> a: 1, b: 1
