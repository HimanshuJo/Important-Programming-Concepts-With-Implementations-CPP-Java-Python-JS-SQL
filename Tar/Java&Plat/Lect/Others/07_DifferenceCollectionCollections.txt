Collection:

    It is an interface

    If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, then we should go for collection

-------

Collections:

    It is a class

    It is a utility class which defines several utility methods (sorting, searching, shuffling etc.)
        for collection object

        e.g. Suppose I've an ArrayList

                ArrayList never talks about sorting

                But if we want to do sorting, then Collections.sort(<arg>) method we can call, and pass
                    this ArrayList as an argument
