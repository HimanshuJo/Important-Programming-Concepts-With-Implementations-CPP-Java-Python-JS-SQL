What is the need of Collections framework:

    Firstly what is the biggest advantage of an Array:

        with just a single variable we can represent number of values

            e.g. int [] Student s = new Student[1000];

                 s[0] = new Student();
                 s[1] = new Customer();  // invalid, compile time error (incompatible types)

    -------

    But there are also number of problems with the arrays:

        1. Arrays are fixed in size

            suppose we allocated 1000 memory allocations and in the run time used only 2, then the rest 998
                memory locations are waste

        2. Arrays can hold only homogeneous data elements

            s[0] =  new Student();
            s[1] = new Customer();  // invalid, compile time error (incompatible types)

            However, we can solve this problem by using Object type arrays

            Object[] a = new Object[1000];
            a[0] =  new Student();  // valid, Student is of object type
            a[1] =  new Customer();  // valid, Customer is also of object type

        3. Arrays concept is not based on some standard data structure

            but every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure

            therefore, underlying data structure is not there for arrays, so ready-made method support
                we can't expect from arrays

                we need to write code for searching, sorting, replacing elements etc.

            -------

            However, if we consider collections every collection class is implemented based on some standard
                data structure

                for every requirement, ready-made method support we can expect

                e.g.

                    Suppose I want to insert all elements in some sorting order

                        so in this case we will consider TreeSet

                            TreeSet automatically insert elements in some sorting order

                    -------

                    Suppose I want to search whether a particular element is there or not

                        Collection already contain one method 'contains()'

                            so for every requirement ready-made method support we can expect in Collections

-------

Advantages of Collections:

    1. Collections are growable in nature

    2. Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous data type

    3. Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure

        read-made method support we can expect for every requirement
