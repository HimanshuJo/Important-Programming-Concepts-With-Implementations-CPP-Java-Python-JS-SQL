Collection:

    It is a group of individual objects

    Suppose I want to represent a group of 5 individual objects as a single entity,
        then we should use Collections

-------

Collection Framework:

    Suppose I want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, then several classes
        and interfaces are required

        so Collection Framework defines several classes and interfaces

            which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity

-------

In the total collection framework, there are in total 9 key interfaces

    Let's suppose we have an 'Interface' and a 'Class'

        to get more information, we've to contact the 'Interface'

            A Class is just a dummy thing that implements an Interface

    Out of 9 key interfaces:

        Collection, List, Set, SortedSet, NavigableSet, Queue

            meant for representing a group of individual objects

        Rest 3 are meant to represent a group of objects as key value pairs

Equivalent terminology in Java and C++:

    Java:

        Collection

        Collection Framework

    C++:

        Container

        STL (Standard Template Library)
