7. Map:

    It is not a child interface of Collection

    If we want to represent a group of objects as key value pairs, then we should consider Map

        where 'key' is an object and 'value' is also an object

    Duplicate keys are not allowed, but values can be duplicate

    What are various implementation classes of Map:

        HashMap

            LinkedHashMap

        WeakHashMap

        IdentityHashMap

        Hashtable  --> Child of 'Dictionary'

            Properties

-------

Versions:

    Map (I)  --> 1.2 v

        HashMap  --> 1.2 v

            LinkedHashMap  --> 1.4 v

        WeakHashMap  --> 1.2 v

        IdentityHashMap  --> 1.4 v

        Dictionary  --> 1.0 v

            Hashtable  --> 1.0 v

                Properties  --> 1.0 v

        -------

        Therefore, these things (Dictionary, Hashtable, Properties) by default consider as legacy classes
