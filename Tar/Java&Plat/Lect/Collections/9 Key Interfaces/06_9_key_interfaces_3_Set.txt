3. Set (I):

        Sometimes the requirement is:

            no duplicates are allowed

            insertion order is not necessary to maintain

        Set is a child interface of Collection only

            If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, where:

                duplicates are not allowed and

                insertion order is not preserved

        There are 2 implementation classes for Set

            a. HashSet

                b. LinkedHashSet (Child class of HashSet)
