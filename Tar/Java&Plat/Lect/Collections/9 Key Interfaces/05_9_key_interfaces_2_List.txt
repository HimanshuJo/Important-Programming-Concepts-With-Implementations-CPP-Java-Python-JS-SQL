2. List (I):

        So we know collection is a group of individual objects

            if we want to represent a group of individual objects, as a single entity
                then we should go for collection

            in that group of individual objects, if our requirement is:

                    duplicates are allowed

                    insertion order must be preserved

                then we should go for List Interface

        List Interface is a child interface of Collection interface only

        For this interface, there are 4 implementation classes:

            1. ArrayList

            2. LinkedList

            3. Vector

                4. Stack

Versions:

    Collection (I)  --> 1.2 v

        List (I)  --> 1.2 v

            ArrayList (1.2 v)

            LinkedList (1.2 v)

            Vector (1.0 v)

                Stack (1.0 v)

    Therefore Vector and Stack are known as Legacy classes
