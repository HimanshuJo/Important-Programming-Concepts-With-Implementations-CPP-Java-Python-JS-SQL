    When should we go for Collection:

        If we want to represent, a group of individual objects as a single entity -> then Collection

        The Collection Interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any collection object

            e.g.

                Suppose I've a group of student objects in my Collection

                For any collection object, some of the most common methods that we can apply are:

                    adding an object (add method is required)

                    removing an object (remove method is required)

                    to check whether an object is available or not (contains method is required)

                    if the collection is empty or not (isEmpty method is required)

                    ...

                All these methods are available inside the Collection Interface

                    Collection Interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any
                        collection object (ArrayList, LinkedList etc.)

    In general Collection is the root interface of the collection framework

    There is no concrete class which implements collection interface directly.
