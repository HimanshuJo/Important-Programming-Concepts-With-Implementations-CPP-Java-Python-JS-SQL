Difference between ArrayList and Vector:

    ArrayList:

        Every method present inside ArrayList is non-synchronized

        Not thread safe

            As ArrayList objects are non-synchronized therefore on ArrayList objects
                at a time multiple threads are allowed to operate

                Hence here we are missing thread safety

        Performance of the system is relatively fast

            As no thread is required to wait

        Non-Legacy class

            ArrayList is introduced in version 1.2

    -------

    Vector:

        Most of the methods present inside Vector are synchronized

        Thread Safe

            In a Vector object at a time only one thread is allowed to operate

        Performance of the system is not very fast

            As only one thread is allowed to act at a time and rest of the threads needed to wait

        Legacy class

            Vector is introduced in version 1.0
