Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList:

    ArrayList:

        Best choice if our frequent operation is retrieval

        Worst choice if our frequent operation is deletion and insertion in the middle

        Underlying data structure is 'resizable' and 'growable' array

        Implements RandomAccess Interface

    LinkedList:

        Best choice if our frequent operation is insertion and deletion in the middle

        Worst choice if our frequent operation is retrieval

        Underlying data structure is 'doubly linked list'

        Doesn't implement RandomAccess Interface
