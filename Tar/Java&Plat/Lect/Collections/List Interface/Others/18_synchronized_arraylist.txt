ArrayList is not thread safe, non-synchronized, then how to get synchronized version of ArrayList

    ArrayList l1 = new ArrayList();

    List l = Collections.synchronizedList(l1);  // Collection class contains synchroizedList method to get
                                                // synchronized version of ArrayList object

    // at this point l is the synchronized version

-------

* By default ArrayList Object is non-synchronized but we can get synchronized version of ArrayList by using
    Collection class synchronizedList() method

    public static List synchronizedList(List I)

        // it is a public method
        // it is a static method
        // it's return type is List

    -------

    Similarly we can get synchronized version of Set and Map objects

        e.g. HashSet, HashMap by default not synchronized

            In this case, to get the synchronized version of both we've to use the corresponding
                methods of collections class

                public static Set synchronizedSet(Set s1);

                public static Map synchronizedMap(Map m);
