key differences between Comparable and Comparator:

    The most valuable difference is that:

        Comparable is meant for 'default natural sorting order'

        Comparator is meant for 'Customizable sorting order'

-------

Comparison table of Comparable and Comparator:

    Comparable:

        1. It is meant for default natural sorting order

        2. It is present in java.lang package

        3. It contains only one method:

            compareTo()

        4. All wrapper classes and String class implements Comparable

    Comparator:

        1. It is meant for customized sorting order

        2. It is present in java.util package

        3. It contains two methods:

            a. compare()

            b. equals()

        4. Most of the time we can say, there is no pre-defined class that implements
            Comparator

            But if we search very carefully there are two classes which implements Comparator

                a. Collator

                b. RuleBasedCollator
