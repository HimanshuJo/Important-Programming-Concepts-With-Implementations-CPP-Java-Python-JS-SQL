Comparison table of Set (I) implemented classes:

    Property  --> Underlying data structure

        HashSet

            HashTable

        LinkedHashSet

            Hybrid data structure (Hashtable + LinkedList)

        TreeSet

            BalancedTree

    -------

    Property  --> Insertion order

        HashSet

            Not preserved

                here all elements will be inserted according to hashcode of the objects

        LinkedHashSet

            Preserved

        TreeSet

            Not applicable (no such terminology)

    -------

    Property  --> Sorting order

        HashSet

            Not applicable (no such terminology)

        LinkedHashSet

            Not applicable (no such terminology)

        TreeSet

            Applicable

    -------

    Property  --> Heterogeneous objects

        HashSet

            Allowed

        LinkedHashSet

            Allowed

        TreeSet

            Not allowed

                However, in one special case it is allowed

                    if we're defining our own sorting by Comparator, then
                        heterogeneous objects are allowed

    -------

    Property  --> Duplicate Objects

        HashSet

            Not Allowed

        LinkedHashSet

            Not Allowed

        TreeSet

            Not Allowed

    -------

    Property  --> Null Acceptance

        HashSet

            Allowed, but only once

        LinkedHashSet

            Allowed, but only once

        TreeSet

            Allowed, but only for empty TreeSet
                as first element null is allowed and in all
                other cases we'll get NullPointerException
