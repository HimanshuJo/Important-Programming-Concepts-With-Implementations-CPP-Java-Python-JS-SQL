The LinkedHashSet class extends HashSet and adds no members of its own

    It is a generic class that has this declaration:

        class LinkedHashSet<E>

            Here, E specifies the type of objects that the set will hold

    Its constructors parallel those in HashSet

-------

LinkedHashSet maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, in the order
    in which they were inserted

    This allows insertion-order iteration over the set

    That is, when cycling through a LinkedHashSet using an iterator, the elements
        will be returned in the order in which they were inserted.

    This is also the order in which they are contained in the string returned by toString()
        when called on a 'LinkedHashSet' object
