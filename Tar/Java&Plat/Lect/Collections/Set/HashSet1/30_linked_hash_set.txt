Difference between LinkedHashSet and HashSet

    I want to represent a group of individual objects where:

            duplicate keys are not allowed

            insertion order 'must be' preserved

        then we should go for LinkedHashSet

    In HashSet, insertion order is not preserved

-------

HashSet:

    Underlying data structure for HashSet is 'Hashtable'

    Insertion order not preserved

    Introduced in 1.2 v


LinkedHashSet:

    Underlying data structure for LinkedHashSet is
        'Hashtable' + 'LinkedList'

    Insertion order is preserved

    Introduced in 1.4 v

-------

import java.util.*;

class HashSetDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedHashSet h =  new LinkedHashSet();
        h.add("B");
        h.add("C");
        h.add("D");
        h.add(null);
        h.add(10);
        System.out.println(h.add("Z"));  // false
        System.out.println(h);  // [B, C, D, null, 10]
    }
}

Where we can use LinkedHashSet concept properly:

    In general we have two types of Memories:

        Primary Memory  --> RAM

            it is very faster

        Secondary Memory  --> HDD

            it is not very faster

        therefore, to balance that performance difference between RAM and HDD in the middle we've
            cache memory

            in the cache memory:

                    duplicates are not allowed

                    order is important

                so that the repeated results we are going to keep inside cache
