The requirement is I want to add String and StringBuffer objects into the TreeSet

    where sorting order is increasing length order

    if two objects having the same length; then consider their alphabetical order

    // So for the input  --> [A, ABC, AA, XX, ABCD, A]

        // expected out is [A, AA, XX, ABC, ABCD, ]

    -------

    Here we don't know which objects we're inserting, it can be String or StringBuffer

    -------

    class MyComparator implements Comparator {
        public int compare(Object obj1, Object obj2) {
            String s1 = obj1.toString();
            String s2 = obj2.toString();
            int l1 = s1.length();
            int l2 = s2.length();

            if (l1 < l2)
                return -1;
            else if (l1 > l2)
                return +1;
            else
                return s1.compareTo(s2);
        }
    }

-------

Note:

    1. If we depending on default natural sorting order then objects should be homogeneous and comparable
        otherwise we'll get runtime exception saying ClassCastException

    2. But we're defining our own sorting by comparator then objects need not be homogeneous and comparable,
        we can insert heterogeneous non comparable objects also
