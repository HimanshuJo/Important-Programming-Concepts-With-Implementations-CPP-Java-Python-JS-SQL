The Set interface defines a set.

    It extends Collection and specifies the behavior of a collection that does not
        allow duplicate elements.

        Therefore, the add( ) method returns false if an attempt is made to add
            duplicate elements to a set.

        With two exceptions, it does not specify any additional methods of its own.

    Set is a generic interface that has this declaration:

        interface Set<E>

            Here, E specifies the type of objects that the set will hold

-------

Beginning with JDK 9, Set includes the 'of( )' factory method,
    which has a number of overloads

    Each version returns an unmodifiable, value-based collection that is comprised of
        the arguments that it is passed.

    The primary purpose of 'of( )' is to provide a convenient, efficient way to create a small Set
        collection.

    There are 12 overloads of 'of( )'

        One takes no arguments and creates an empty set.

            It is shown here:

                static <E> Set<E> of()

        Ten overloads take from 1 to 10 arguments and create a list that contains the specified
            elements

            static <E> Set<E> of(E obj1)

            static <E> Set<E> of(E obj1, E obj2)

            static <E> Set<E> of(E obj1, E obj2, E obj3)

            ...

            static <E> Set<E> of(E obj1, E obj2, E obj3, E obj4, E obj5, E obj6
                                    E obj7, E obj8, E obj9, E obj10)

        The final of() overload specifies a varargs parameter that takes an arbitrary
            number of elements or an array of elements

            static <E> Set<E> of(E ... objs)

        -------

        For all versions, null elements are not allowed

        -------

        Beginning with JDK 10, Set includes the static 'copyOf( )'' method

            static <E> Set<E> copyOf(Collection <? extends E> from)

                It returns a set that contains the same elements as 'from'

                null values are not allowed

                The returned set is unmodifiable
