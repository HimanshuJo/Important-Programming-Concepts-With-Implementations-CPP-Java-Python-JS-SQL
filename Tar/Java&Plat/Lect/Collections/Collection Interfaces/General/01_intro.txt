The 'Collections Framework' defines several core interfaces.

The 'Collection Interfaces' determine the fundamental nature of the
    collection classes.

    Put differently, the concrete classes simply provide different
        implementations of the standard interfaces.

The interfaces that underpin collections are as follows:

    Interfaces:

        Collection:

            It enables us to work with groups of objects

            It is at the top of the collections hierarchy

        Dequeue:

            It extends 'Queue' to handle a double-ended queue

        List:

            It extends 'Collection' to handle sequences (list of objects)

        NavigableSet:

            It extends 'SortedSet (I)' to handle retrieval of elements based on closest-match searches

        Queue:

            It extends 'Collection' to handle special types of lists in which elements are
                removed only from the head

        Set:

            It extends 'Collection' to handle sets, which must contain unique elements

        SortedSet:

            It extends 'Set' to handle sorted sets

-------

In addition to the collection interfaces, collections also use the:

    Comparator,

        defines how two objects are compared;

    RandomAccess,

        a list indicates that it supports efficient, random access to its elements.

    For enumerating the objects within a collection

        Iterator,
        ListIterator and
        Spliterator

    -------

    To provide the greatest flexibility in their use, the collection interfaces
        allow some methods to be optional.

        The optional methods enable you to modify the contents of a collection.

        Collections that support these methods are called modifiable.

            Collections that do not allow their contents to be changed are called
                unmodifiable.

                If an attempt is made to use one of these methods on an unmodifiable
                    collection, an 'UnsupportedOperationException' is thrown.

                All the built-in collections are modifiable.
