/*
 * 
 * Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following
 * algorithm:
 * 
 * Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating
 * characters in chars:
 * 
 * If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
 * 
 * Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
 * 
 * The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead be
 * stored in the input character array chars.
 * 
 * Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple
 * characters in chars.
 * 
 * After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the
 * array.
 * 
 * Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"] Output: Return 6, and the first
 * 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
 * Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to
 * "a2b2c3".
