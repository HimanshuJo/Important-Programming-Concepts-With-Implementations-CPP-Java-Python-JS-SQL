/*
 *
 * While Mahmoud and Ehab were practicing for IOI, they found a problem which
 * name was Longest common subsequence.
 *
 * They solved it, and then Ehab challenged Mahmoud with another problem.
 *
 * Given two strings a and b, find the length of their longest uncommon
 * subsequence, which is the longest string that is a subsequence of one of them
 * and not a subsequence of the other.
 *
 * A subsequence of some string is a sequence of characters that appears in the
 * same order in the string,
 *
 * The appearances don't have to be consecutive, for example, strings "ac",
 * "bc", "abc" and "a" are subsequences of string "abc" while strings "abbc" and
 * "acb" are not.
 *
 * The empty string is a subsequence of any string. Any string is a subsequence
 * of itself.
 *
 * Input
 *
 * The first line contains string a, and the second line â€” string b.
 *
 * Both of these strings are non-empty and consist of lowercase letters of
 * English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger than 105
 * characters. Output
 *
 * If there's no uncommon subsequence, print "-1". Otherwise print the length of
 * the longest uncommon subsequence of a and b.
 *
 * Examples Input
 *
 * abcd defgh
 *
 * Output
 *
 * 5
