 * Nastia has 2 positive integers A and B

 * She defines that:

 * 
 * Otherwise, the integer is nearly good, if it is divisible by A
 * 
 * For example, if A=6 and B=4,
 * 
 * the integers 24 and 72 are good, the integers 6, 660 and 12 are nearly good,
 * 
 * the integers 16, 7 are neither good nor nearly good.

 * Good -> divisible by A.B
 * 
 * Nearly Good -> divisible by A
 * 
 * We need to find x, y, y
 * 
 * such that one of them is good and the other two are nearyl good, and x + y =
 * z
 * 
 * -------
 * 
 * Let's suppose the first number divisible by A is: mA,
 * 
 * and the other number divisible by A is: nA
 * 
 * the number disivible by A.B is: oAB
 * 
 * If we look at the above three numbers, one thing we can notice is that among
 * mA, nA and oAB oAB is the largest number
 * 
 * Therefore we can assign: oAB as z nA as y mA as x
 * 
 * -------
 * 
 * From the above equation we get that: mA + nA = oAB
 * 
 * this is basically A(m + n) = oAB
 * 
 * => m + n = oB
 * 
 * As we don't have to optimize the values, therefore let's assume that o = 1
 * 
 * therefore m + n = B
 * 
 * let's assume m = 1
 * 
 * therefore 1 + n = B
 * 
 * Hence n = B - 1
 * 
 * Finally our values are: m -> 1 n -> B - 1 o -> 1
 * 
 * -------
 * 
 * Ans = A + (B - 1)A = AB
 * 
 * -------
 * 
 * Some edge cases we have to take into account: what is B = 1
 * 
 * there is no way for B = 1 we can find a solution
 * 
 * -------
 * 
 * what is B = 2
 * 
 * the equaltion become: A + (2 - 1)A = AB => A + A = 2A --> here again
 * 
 * our ans in that case will be: A + 3A = 4A
