Spring MVC gives us a special class named 'ModelAndView'

    which can hold two things

        1. View

        2. Data

    we can add multiple data with the help of

        addObject() method

-------

Why do we need a service layer, instead let the controller communicate directly to a 'Repo' for CRUD operations:

    Because as a controller, we are always not sure that the data is coming from the database

        sometimes data might come from the network, or sometimes data come from the input provided by the user

            so we need to process something and that processing should be done in the service layer

        In case the data is coming from the repository, then the service layer will interact with the repo

-------

@RequestParam is something with which we can fetch the value from a client
