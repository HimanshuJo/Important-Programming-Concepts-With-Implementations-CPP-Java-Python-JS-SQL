Consider two scenarios:

    Normally in Spring Boot we don't always put all our pages in 'webapp' folder

        as it is a public folder, we sometimes want to move our pages to more private folders

    Also while return a .jsp file in a method we don't always put the .jsp extension

        we can specify the name of the file without extension

    -------

    So in this case to do any configuration, we have a special file in

        src/main/resources  --> 'application.properties'

-------

Different properties:

    1. Prefix

        Path (dir. e.g. where to look for the template) of a page is defined with the help of a prefix

            e.g. spring.mvc.view.prefix=/pages/

    2. Suffix

        Extension of a page is defined with the help of a suffix

            e.g. spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
