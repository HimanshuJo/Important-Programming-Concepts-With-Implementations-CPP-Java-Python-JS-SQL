To start a Web App first we need a 'Controller'

    For that we need to annotate the controller class as

        @Controller

    Now whenever I get a request, our Spring Boot application will make sure that this controller will
        handle all the request

        Who is doing that?

            Thanks to auto-configuration in Spring boot using

                import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
                @RequestMapping("home")

                we can mention for which request I want to handle this function

    -------

    How do we call a template or a page while handling a request?

        we can just simply do

            return "name.extension" at the end of the function

    -------

    @ResponseBody

        This annotation says that, whatever are returning inside a function is actually the data

        so in this case if we say

            return "home.jsp"  // home.jsp will be treated as a string data and it won't look for the .jsp page

    -------

    Spring Boot doesn't support jsp, for that we have to add a support in pom.xml file

        adding the code for the dependency in pom.xml

        now Spring Boot knows how to convert a JSP into servlet
