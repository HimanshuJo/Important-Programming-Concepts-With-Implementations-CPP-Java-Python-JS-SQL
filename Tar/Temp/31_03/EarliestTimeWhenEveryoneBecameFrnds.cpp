// The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends
/*
Given a group of N people, each having a unique ID value from 
0 to (N – 1) and an array arr[] of M elements of the 
form {U, V, time} representing that the person U will 
become acquainted with person V at the given time. 
Let’s say that person U is acquainted with person V if
U is friends with V, or U is a friend of someone acquainted 
with V. The task is to find the earliest time at which every 
person became acquainted with each other.

Input: N = 4, arr[] = {{0, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}}
Output: 4
Explanation: Initially, the number of people are 4, i.e, {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}. 

	At time = 2, {0} and {1} became friends. Therefore, the group of acquainted people becomes {0, 1}, {2}, {3}.
	At time = 3, {1} and {2} became friends. Therefore, the group of acquainted people becomes {0, 1, 2}, {3}.
	At time = 4, {2} and {3} became friends. Therefore, the group of acquainted people becomes {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Hence, at time = 4, every person became acquainted with each other.

Input: N = 6, arr[] = {{0, 1, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {2, 3, 14}, {1, 5, 24}, {2, 4, 12}, {0, 3, 42}, {1, 2, 41}, {4, 5, 11}}
Output: 24
