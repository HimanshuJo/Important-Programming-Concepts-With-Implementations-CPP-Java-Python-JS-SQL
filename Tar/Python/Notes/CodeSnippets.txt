range() function syntax and arguments:

    range(start, stop[, step])

        It takes three arguments.

            Out of the three 2 arguments are optional. I.e., start and step are the optional arguments.

        A 'start' argument is a starting number of the sequence. i.e.,
            lower limit.

            By default, it starts with 0 if not specified.

        A 'stop' argument is an upper limit. i.e., generate numbers up to this number,
            The range() doesn’t include this number in the result.

            So the last number is stop - step.

        The 'step' is a difference between each number in the result.

            The default value of the step is 1 if not specified.
