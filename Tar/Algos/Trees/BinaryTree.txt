Types of Binary Tree:

	Rooted:

		A rooted binary tree has a root node and every node has at most two children

	-------

	Full Binary Tree:

		Sometimes referred to a proper or plane binary tree, is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children

		Another way of defining a full binary tree is a recursive definition

		A full binary tree is either:

			A single vertex

			A tree whose root node has two sub-trees, both of which are full binary trees

		Examples:

			     18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40


             18
           /    \   
         15     20    
        /  \       
      40    50   
    /   \
   30   50

               18
            /     \  
          40       30  
                   /  \
                 100   40

	  	-------

	  	Properties of Full Binary Tree:

			The number of nodes n in a Full Binary Tree, is 
				
				at least n = 2 * h + 1

				at most n = 2^(h + 1) - 1

				A tree consisting of only a root node has a height of 0

 	-------

	Complete Binary Tree:

		In this tree every level, except the last level is completely filled, and all the nodes in the last level are as far as left as possible.

		It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes at the last level h

		-------

		Properties:

			Nodes in the last level of a Complete Binary Tree can be between 1 to 2^h

	-------

	Perfect Binary Tree:

		It is a binary tree in which all the interior nodes have two children and all the leaves have the same depth or are at the same level.

		An example of a perfect binary tree is the ancestry chart of a person to a given depth, as each person has
			exactly two parents

		A Perfect Binary Tree is therefore always complete, but a Complete Binary Tree is not necessarily perfect

		-------

		Properties:

			The number of leaf nodes 'l' in a perfect binary tree is

				l = (n + 1) / 2

				A Full Binary Tree with l leaves has n = 2l-1 nodes

	-------
	
	Balanced Binary Tree:

		It's a binary tree in which the left and the right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1
