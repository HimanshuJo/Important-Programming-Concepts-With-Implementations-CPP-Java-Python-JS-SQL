Exponential Time — O(2^n)

    An algorithm is said to have an exponential time complexity when the growth
        doubles with each addition to the input data set.

    This kind of time complexity is usually seen in brute-force algorithms.

    -------

    Another example of an exponential time algorithm is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers:

    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
