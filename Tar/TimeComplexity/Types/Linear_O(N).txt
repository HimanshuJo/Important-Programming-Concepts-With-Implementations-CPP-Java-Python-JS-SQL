Linear Time â€” O(n)

    An algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity when the running time
        increases at most linearly with the size of the input data.

        This is the best possible time complexity when the algorithm must examine
            all values in the input data.

    For example:

        for value in data:
            print(value)
