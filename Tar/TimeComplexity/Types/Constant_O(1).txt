Constant Time — O(1):

    An algorithm is said to have a constant time when it is not dependent on the input data (n).

    No matter the size of the input data, the running time will always be the same.

    For example:

            if a > b:
                return True
            else:
                return False

    -------

    Now, let’s take a look at the function get_first which returns the first element of a list:

        def get_first(data):
            return data[0]

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            data = [1, 2, 9, 8, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5]
            print(get_first(data))

    Independently of the input data size, it will always have the same running time since
        it only gets the first value from the list.
