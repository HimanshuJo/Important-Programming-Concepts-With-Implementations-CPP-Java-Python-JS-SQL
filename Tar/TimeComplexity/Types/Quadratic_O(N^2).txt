Quadratic Time — O(n²)

    An algorithm is said to have a quadratic time complexity when it needs to
        perform a linear time operation for each value in the input data,

        for example:

            for x in data:
                for y in data:
                    print(x, y)

    Bubble sort is a great example of quadratic time complexity since for each value
        it needs to compare to all other values in the list,

        let’s see an example:

            def bubble_sort(data):
                swapped = True
                while swapped:
                    swapped = False
                    for i in range(len(data)-1):
                        if data[i] > data[i+1]:
                            data[i], data[i+1] = data[i+1], data[i]
                            swapped = True

            if __name__ == '__main__':
                data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0]
                bubble_sort(data)
                print(data)
