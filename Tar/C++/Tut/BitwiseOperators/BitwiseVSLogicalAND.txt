A Bitwise And operator is represented as ‘&’ and a logical operator is represented as ‘&&’. 

	The following are some basic differences between the two operators.

	a) The logical and operator ‘&&’ expects its operands to be boolean expressions (either 1 or 0) 
		and returns a boolean value.

		The bitwise and operator ‘&’ work on Integral (short, int, unsigned, char, bool, unsigned char, long) values 
			and return Integral value.

		#include<stdio.h>
		int main()
		{
			int x = 3; //...0011
			int y = 7; //...0111

			// A typical use of '&&'
			if (y > 1 && y > x)
			printf("y is greater than 1 AND x\n");

			// A typical use of '&'
			int z = x & y; // 0011
			
			printf ("z = %d", z);

			return 0;
		}

		-------

		Output

			y is greater than 1 AND x
			z = 3

	-------

	b) If an integral value is used as an operand for ‘&&’ which is supposed to work on boolean values, 
		the following rule is used in C. 
		
		Zero is considered as false and non-zero is considered as true. 

		For example in the following program x and y are considered as 1.

		C Program:

			#include<stdio.h>
			// Example that uses non-boolean expression as
			// operand for '&&'
			int main()
			{
				int x = 2, y = 5;
				printf("%d", x&&y);
				return 0;
			}

		-------

		Output
		
			1

		-------

		It is compiler error to use the non-integral expression as operand for bitwise &. 

		For example the following program shows compiler error.

		C Program:

			#include<stdio.h>
			// Example that uses non-integral expression as
			// operator for '&'
			int main()
			{
			float x = 2.0, y = 5.0;
				printf("%d", x&y);
				return 0;
			}
		
		-------

		Output: 

			error: invalid operands to binary & (have 'float' and 'float')

	-------

	c) The ‘&&’ operator doesn’t evaluate the second operand if the first operand becomes false. 

		Similarly ‘||’ doesn’t evaluate the second operand when first operand becomes true. 

		The bitwise ‘&’ and ‘|’ operators always evaluate their operands. 

		C Program:

			#include<stdio.h>
			int main()
			{
				int x = 0;

				// 'Geeks in &&' is NOT printed because x is 0
				printf("%d\n", (x && printf("Geeks in && ")));

				// 'Geeks in &' is printed
				printf("%d\n", (x & printf("Geeks in & ")));

				return 0;
			}
