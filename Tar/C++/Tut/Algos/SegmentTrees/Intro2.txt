A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, 
	while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. 

	This includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements a[l…r], or finding the minimum element in a such a range in O(logn) time. 

	Between answering such queries the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even change the elements of a 
	whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements a[l…r] to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment).

	In general a Segment Tree is a very flexible data structure, and a huge number of problems can be solved with it. 

	Additionally it is also possible to apply more complex operations and answer more complex queries. 

	In particular the Segment Tree can be easily generalized to larger dimensions. 

	For instance with a two-dimensional Segment Tree you can answer sum or minimum queries over some subrectangle of a given matrix. 

	However only in O(log2n) time.

-------

One important property of Segment Trees is, that they require only a linear amount of memory. 

	The standard Segment Tree requires 4n vertices for working on an array of size n.

-------

Simplest form of a Segment Tree:

	To start easy, we consider the simplest form of a Segment Tree. 

	We want to answer sum queries efficiently. 

		The formal definition of our task is: We have an array a[0…n−1], and the Segment Tree must be able to find the 
			sum of elements between the indices l and r (i.e. computing the sum ∑ri=la[i]), 
			and also handle changing values of the elements in the array (i.e. perform assignments of the form a[i]=x). 

		The Segment Tree should be able to process both queries in O(logn) time.

-------

Structure of the Segment Tree

	We compute and store the sum of the elements of the whole array, i.e. the sum of the segment a[0…n−1]. 

	We then split the array into two halves a[0…n/2] and a[n/2+1…n−1] and compute the sum of each halve and store them. 

	Each of these two halves in turn also split in half, their sums are computed and stored. 

	And this process repeats until all segments reach size 1. 

		In other words we start with the segment a[0…n−1], split the current segment in half 
		(if it has not yet become a segment containing a single element), and then calling the same procedure for both halves. 

		For each such segment we store the sum of the numbers on it.

	We can say, that these segments form a binary tree: 

		the root of this tree is the segment a[0…n−1], and each vertex (except leaf vertices) has exactly two child vertices.

		This is why the data structure is called "Segment Tree", even though in most implementations the tree is not constructed explicitly.


											a[0...4]
											  sum=3
									 /                  \
								a[0...2]                a[3...4]
								  sum=2                   sum=1
							    /		\               /       \
						    a[0...1]    a[2...2]     a[3...3]   a[4...4]
						      sum=4       sum=-2      sum=8      sum=-7
					        /     \
				        a[0...0]  a[1...1]
				         sum=1     sum=3

From this short description of the data structure, we can already conclude that a Segment Tree only requires a linear number of vertices. 

	The first level of the tree contains a single node (the root), the second level will contain two vertices, 
	in the third it will contain four vertices, until the number of vertices reaches n. 

	Thus the number of vertices in the worst case can be estimated by the sum 1+2+4+⋯+2⌈log2n⌉=2⌈log2n⌉+1<4n.

	It is worth noting that whenever n is not a power of two, not all levels of the Segment Tree will be completely filled. 

		We can see that behavior in the image. For now we can forget about this fact, but it will become important later during the implementation.

	The height of the Segment Tree is O(logn), because when going down from the root to the leaves the size of 
		the segments decreases approximately by half.

-------

Construction:

	Before constructing the segment tree, we need to decide:

		1. The value that gets stored at each node of the segment tree. 
			For example, in a sum segment tree, a node would store the sum of the elements in its range [l,r].

		2. The merge operation that merges two siblings in a segment tree. 
			For example, in a sum segment tree, the two nodes corresponding to the ranges a[l1…r1] and a[l2…r2] would be merged into a 
			node corresponding to the range a[l1…r2] by adding the values of the two nodes.

		Note that a vertex is a "leaf vertex", if its corresponding segment covers only one value in the original array. 
		It is present at the lowermost level of a segment tree. Its value would be equal to the (corresponding) element a[i].

		Now, for construction of the segment tree, we start at the bottom level (the leaf vertices) and assign them their respective values. 
		On the basis of these values, we can compute the values of the previous level, using the merge function. 

		And on the basis of those, we can compute the values of the previous, and repeat the procedure until we reach the root vertex.

		It is convenient to describe this operation recursively in the other direction, i.e., from the root vertex to the leaf vertices.
		The construction procedure, if called on a non-leaf vertex, does the following:

			1. Recursively construct the values of the two child vertices

			2. Merge the computed values of these children.

		We start the construction at the root vertex, and hence, we are able to compute the entire segment tree.

		The time complexity of this construction is O(n), assuming that the merge operation is constant time 
		(the merge operation gets called n times, which is equal to the number of internal nodes in the segment tree).

-------

Sum queries:

	For now we are going to answer sum queries. As an input we receive two integers l and r, 
		and we have to compute the sum of the segment a[l…r] in O(logn) time.

	To do this, we will traverse the Segment Tree and use the precomputed sums of the segments. 
		Let's assume that we are currently at the vertex that covers the segment a[tl…tr]. 

		There are three possible cases.

			1.	The easiest case is when the segment a[l…r] is equal to the corresponding segment of the current vertex 
					(i.e. a[l…r]=a[tl…tr]), then we are finished and can return the precomputed sum that is stored in the vertex.

			2. 	Alternatively the segment of the query can fall completely into the domain of either the left or the right child. 
					Recall that the left child covers the segment a[tl…tm] and the right vertex covers the segment 
					a[tm+1…tr] with tm=(tl+tr)/2. 

					In this case we can simply go to the child vertex, which corresponding segment covers the query segment, 
						and execute the algorithm described here with that vertex.

			3.	And then there is the last case, the query segment intersects with both children. 
					In this case we have no other option as to make two recursive calls, one for each child. 

					First we go to the left child, compute a partial answer for this vertex 
					(i.e. the sum of values of the intersection between the segment of the query and the segment of the left child), 

					then go to the right child, compute the partial answer that vertex, and then combine the answers by adding them. 

					In other words, since the left child represents the segment a[tl…tm] and the right child the segment a[tm+1…tr], 
						we compute the sum query a[l…tm] using the left child, and the sum query a[tm+1…r] using the right child.

	So processing a sum query is a function that recursively calls itself once with either the left or the right child 
		(without changing the query boundaries), or twice, once for the left and once for the right child 
		(by splitting the query into two subqueries). And the recursion ends, whenever the boundaries of 
		the current query segment coincides with the boundaries of the segment of the current vertex. 
		In that case the answer will be the precomputed value of the sum of this segment, which is stored in the tree.

	In other words, the calculation of the query is a traversal of the tree, which spreads through all necessary branches of the tree, 
	and uses the precomputed sum values of the segments in the tree.

	Obviously we will start the traversal from the root vertex of the Segment Tree.

	The procedure is illustrated in the following image. 

		Again the array a=[1,3,−2,8,−7] is used, and here we want to compute the sum ∑4i=2a[i]. 

		The colored vertices will be visited, and we will use the precomputed values of the green vertices. 
		This gives us the result −2+1=−1.



											a[0...4]*
											  sum=3
									 /                  \
								a[0...2]*                a[3...4]*
								  sum=2                   sum=1
							    /		\               /       \
						    a[0...1]    a[2...2]*     a[3...3]   a[4...4]
						      sum=4       sum=-2      sum=8      sum=-7
					        /     \
				        a[0...0]  a[1...1]
				         sum=1     sum=3

Why is the complexity of this algorithm O(logn)? 

	To show this complexity we look at each level of the tree. 

	It turns out, that for each level we only visit not more than four vertices. 
		And since the height of the tree is O(logn), we receive the desired running time.

	Proof:

		We can show that this proposition (at most four vertices each level) is true by induction.

		At the first level, we only visit one vertex, the root vertex, so here we visit less than four vertices

		Now let's look at an arbitrary level. By induction hypothesis, we visit at most four vertices. 
			If we only visit at most two vertices, the next level has at most four vertices

			That's trivial, because each vertex can only cause at most two recursive calls

		So let's assume that we visit three or four vertices in the current level.
			From those vertices, we will analyze the vertices in the middle more carefully. 

			Since the sum query asks for the sum of a continuous subarray, we know that segments corresponding 
			to the visited vertices in the middle will be completely covered by the segment of the sum query.

			Therefore these vertices will not make any recursive calls. So only the most left, and the most right vertex will
		 	have the potential to make recursive calls. 

		 	And those will only create at most four recursive calls, so also the next level will satisfy the assertion. 
			 We can say that one branch approaches the left boundary of the query, and the second branch approaches the right one.

		Therefore we visit at most 4logn vertices in total, and that is equal to a running time of O(logn).

	In conclusion the query works by dividing the input segment into several sub-segments for which all the sums are already 
	precomputed and stored in the tree. And if we stop partitioning whenever the query segment coincides with the vertex segment, 
	then we only need O(logn) such segments, which gives the effectiveness of the Segment Tree.
