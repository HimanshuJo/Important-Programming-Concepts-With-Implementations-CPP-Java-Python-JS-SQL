It can be used to solve many simple counting problems,
such as how many ways there are to put n indistinguishable balls into k distinguishable bins

-------

Statements of theorems:

The stars and bars method is often introduced specifically to prove the following two theorems 
of elementary combinatorics concerning the number of solutions to an equation

-------

Theorem one

	For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of positive integers whose sum is n is equal to the number of (k − 1)-element subsets of a set with n − 1 elements.

	For example, if n=10 and k=4, the theorem gives the number of solutions to:

	x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=10

	with x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}>0

	The answer is given by the binomial coefficient {n-1} \choose {k-1}.

	For the above example, there are {\binom {10-1}{4-1}}={\binom {9}{3}}=84} of them.

	These consist of the permutations of the tuples
	(1,1,1,7),
	(1,1,2,6),
	(1,1,3,5),
	(1,1,4,4),
	(1,2,2,5),
	(1,2,3,4),
	(1,3,3,3),
	(2,2,2,4),
	(2,2,3,3)}

-------

Theorem two

	For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is n is equal to the number of multisets of cardinality k − 1 taken from a set of size n + 1.

	For example, if n=10 and k=4, the theorem gives the number of solutions to:

		x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=10

		with x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}>0

	The answer is given by the binomial coefficient {\binom {n+k-1}{k-1}}}. 

	For the above example, there are {\binom {10+4-1}{4-1}}={\binom {13}{3}}=286} of them.

Proofs via the method of stars and bars

	Theorem one proof

		Suppose there are n objects (represented here by stars) to be placed into k bins, such that all bins contain at least one object. 

		The bins are distinguishable (say they are numbered 1 to k) but the n stars are not (so configurations are only distinguished by the number of stars present in each bin). 

		A configuration is thus represented by a k-tuple of positive integers, as in the statement of the theorem.

		For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, start by placing the stars in a line:

						★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
					Fig. 1: Seven objects, represented by stars

		The configuration will be determined once it is known which is the first star going to the second bin, and the first star going to the third bin, etc.. 

		This is indicated by placing k − 1 bars between the stars. Because no bin is allowed to be empty (all the variables are positive), there is at most one bar between any pair of stars.

						For example:

						★  ★  ★  ★  | ★ |  ★  ★

						  ^   ^  ^    ^   ^    ^    -> n-1 gaps required

		Fig. 2: These two bars give rise to three bins containing 4, 1, and 2 objects

		There are n − 1 gaps between stars. 
		A configuration is obtained by choosing k − 1 of these gaps to contain a bar;
		
			therefore there are {\binom {n-1}{k-1}}} possible combinations.

	-------

	Theorem two proof

		In this case, the weakened restriction of non-negativity instead of positivity means that we can place 
		multiple bars between stars, before the first star and after the last star.

		For example, when n = 7 and k = 5, the tuple (4, 0, 1, 2, 0) may be represented by the following diagram:

					★ ★ ★ ★ | | ★ | ★ ★ |

		Fig. 3: These four bars give rise to five bins containing 4, 0, 1, 2, and 0 objects

		To see that there are {binom {n+k-1}{k-1}}} possible arrangements, observe that any arrangement of stars and bars 
		consists of a total of n + k − 1 objects, n of which are stars and k − 1 of which are bars. 

		Thus, we only need to choose k − 1 of the n + k − 1 positions to be bars (or, equivalently, choose n of the positions to be stars).

		Theorem 1 can now be restated in terms of Theorem 2, because the requirement that all the variables are positive is 
		equivalent to pre-assigning each variable a 1, and asking for the number of solutions when each variable is non-negative.

		For example:

		x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=10

		with x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}>0

		is equivalent to:

		x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=6
		with x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}\geq 0

Example 1

	If one wishes to count the number of ways to distribute seven indistinguishable one dollar coins among 
	Amber, Ben, and Curtis so that each of them receives at least one dollar, one may observe that distributions are essentially 
	equivalent to tuples of three positive integers whose sum is 7. 

	(Here the first entry in the tuple is the number of coins given to Amber, and so on.) 

	Thus stars and bars theorem 1 applies, with n = 7 and k = 3, and there are {7-1 \choose 3-1}=15 ways to distribute the coins

	-------

	If it is allowed to give either Amber, Ben or Curtis no coin, then
		Number of ways to distribute seven indistinguishable one dollar coins among these friends is:

		{7+3-1 \choose 3-1}=36 ways to distribute the coins

		e.g. 1 way is:

			1 | | 6 (Amber receives 1, Ben 0, Curtis 6)

-------

Example 2

	If n = 5, k = 4, and a set of size k is {a, b, c, d}, then ★|★★★||★ could represent 
	either the multiset {a, b, b, b, d} or the 4-tuple (1, 3, 0, 1). 

	The representation of any multiset for this example should use SAB2 with n = 5 stars and k − 1 = 3 bars to give 

		{5+4-1 \choose 4-1}={8 \choose 3}=56
