Handshake Problem:

	In a group of n people, how many different handshakes are possible?

		First, let's find the total handshakes that are possible. 

		That is to say, if each person shook hands once with every other person in the group, what is the total number of handshakes that occur?

		A way of considering this is that each person in the group will make a total of n-1 handshakes. 

		Since there are n people, there would be n times (n-1) total handshakes. 

		In other words, the total number of people multiplied by the number of handshakes that each can make will be the total handshakes. 

		A group of 3 would make a total of 3(3-1) = 3 * 2 = 6. Each person registers 2 handshakes with the other 2 people in the group; 3 * 2.

		Total Handshakes = n(n-1)

		However, this includes each handshake twice (1 with 2, 2 with 1, 1 with 3, 3 with 1, 2 with 3 and 3 with 2) and
		since the orginal question wants to know how many different handshakes are possible we must divide by 2 to get the correct answer.

	Total Different Handshakes = n(n-1)/2

Handshake Problem as a Combinations Problem:

	We can also solve this Handshake Problem as a combinations problem as C(n,2).

		n (objects) = number of people in the group
		r (sample) = 2, the number of people involved in each different handshake

		The order of the items chosen in the subset does not matter so for a group of 3 
			it will count 1 with 2, 
			1 with 3, and 
			2 with 3 but ignore 

			2 with 1,
			3 with 1, and 
			3 with 2 

			because these last 3 are duplicates of the first 3 respectively.

		C(n,r)=n!/(r!(n−r)!)
		C(n,2)=n!/(2!(n−2)!)
		expanding the factorials,

		=1×2×3...×(n−2)×(n−1)×(n)/(2×1×(1×2×3...×(n−2)))
		cancelling and simplifying,

		=(n−1)×(n)/2=n(n−1)/2
		which is the same as the equation above.
