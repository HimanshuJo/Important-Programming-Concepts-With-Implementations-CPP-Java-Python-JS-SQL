The Pigeonhole Principle:

	If k + 1 or more pigeons are distributed among k pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole contains two or more
		pigeons

		Proof:

			The contrapositive of the statement is:

				If each pigeonhole contains at most one pigeon, then there are at most k pigeons.

-------

Pigeonhole Principle (General):
	If n or more pigeons are distributed among k > 0 pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole contains
		at least math.ceil(n / k)

	Proof:

		Suppose each pigeonhole contains at most Math.ceil(n / k) - 1 pigeons

		Then the total number of pigeons is at most 
			k * (Math.ceil(n/k) - 1) 
			< k(n/k) 
			= n pigeons

-------

Suppose a flock of 20 pigeons flies into a set of 19 pigeonholes to roost.

	Because there are 20 pigeons but only 19 pigeonholes, at least one of these 19 pigeonholes must have
		two pigeons in it.

	So, this principle in general states that, if there are more pigeons than the pigeonholes, then there must be
		at least one pigeonhole with at least two pigeons in it

	-------

	Theorem:

		1. If "A" is the average number of pigeons per hole, where A is not an integer then,
			* At least one pigeon hole contains ceil(A) [smallest integer greater than or equal to A] pigeons

			* Remaining pigeon holes contains at most floor(A) [largest integer less than or equal to A] pigeons

		2. We can say that, if n + 1 objects are put into n boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects

		-------

		The abstract formulation of the principle:
			Let X and Y be finite sets and let f: A -> B be a function:

				a. If X has more elements than Y, then f is not one-to-one

				b. If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is onto, then f is one-to-one

				c. If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is one-to-one, then f is onto

		-------

		Pigeonhole principle is one of the simplest but most useful ideas in mathematics.

			E.g. 1: If (kn + 1) pigeons are kept in n pigeon holes where K is a positive integer, what is the
					average number of pigeons per pigeon hole?

			Sol. Average number of pigeons per hole = (kn + 1) / n
													= k + 1/n

			 	Therefore there will be at least one pigeonhole which will contain at least (k + 1) pigeons
			 		i.e ceil[k + 1/n]

			 		and remaining will contain at most k, i.e. floor [k + 1/n] pigeons

		 		hence, minimum number of pigeons required to ensure that at least one pigeon hole contains (k + 1) pigeons
		 			is (kn + 1)

	-------

	Example 2:

		A bag contains 10 red marbles, 10 white marbles, and 10 blue marbles.

		What is the minimum no. of marbles you have to choose randomly from the bag to ensure that we get 4 marbles
			of the same color?

	Solution:

		Applying pigeonhole principle:

			No. of colors (pigeonholes) n = 3

			No. of marbles (pigeons) k + 1 = 4

			Therefore the minimum no. of marbles required = kn + 1
				By simplifying we get kn + 1 = 10

					as k = 3
					   n = 3

					   => kn + 1 = 3*3 + 1 = 10
