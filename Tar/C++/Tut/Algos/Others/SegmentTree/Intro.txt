Use cases of Segment Tree:

	It helps with range query in an array

	Suppose we have an array
		
		arr = 		{-1, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1}
		
		indexes =	{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

		Example of some of the queries we can ask:
			What is the minimum from index 2 to 4 in this array
				ans = 0

			What is the minimum from 0 to 3 in this array
				ans = -1

			What is the maximum in certain range?

			What is the sum in certain range? etc.

-------

Without Segment Trees if we try to find out the answer, let's say for an array that has millions of numbers
	one way to do a linear search that will result in
		O(mn) Time
			where m -> is the number of queries
				  n -> is the size of the array

    other way is to create a square matrix, and fill up the matrix by finding out the min
    	for each range

    	once the matrix has been built we can easily answer the min queries in O(1) time,
    	however, building up the matrix will take O(n^2) time
    		also O(n^2) space to maintain this matrix

-------

Segment Trees takes O(n) time to build

Segment Trees takes O(n) space to maintain a segment tree

Segment Trees answers the query in O(log n) time

-------

Segment Tree:

	It is a binary tree, ans the elements of an array are the leaves of that binary tree

		Each node in the Binary Tree is maintaining the minimum for a range

	Suppose I am looking for a particular range, there are three rules which we need to take into account

		1. Partial Overlap

			here we have to look into both the sides of the tree

		2. Total Overlap

			here we have to already stop our search

			it means an interval is totally inside the other interval or is exactly equal to that interval
				e.g. [3, 5] totally overlaps [0, 4]

		3. No Overlap

-------

It will appears like we are searching the entire tree, but in reality it turns out that at max we will go in
	4 different depths, so in worst case the time will be 4 * log(n)

-------

Segment Trees for arrays:

	If my array length is a power of 2, then

		the size of the segment tree will be:
			len(array) * 2 - 1

	If my array length is not the power of 2, then

		I will firstly find the next power of 2, and then calculate the size by the same formula

		(NextPowerOfTwo) * 2 - 1

	-------

	Suppose we have an array arr = {-1, -1, 3, -1, 0, 3, 6}

		To get the left child for a particular node we can use the formula

			leftChild = 2*i + 1, where i is the index of that particular element in the array

		To get the right child for a particular node we can use the formula

			rightChild = 2*i + 2, where i is the index of that particular element in the array

		To get the parent for a particular node we can use the formula

			parent = (i - 1)/2, where i is the index of that particular element in the array

	-------

	The total size of the array in the worst case can be:

		4n, therefore the space complexity is O(n)

	The total time to build the entire array in worst case can be O(n)

-------

Recursive Function to construct Seg Tree for a given array

	For this we will pre-initialize of segTree or resultant array with really big numbers

	Also the length of the resultant segment tree is dependent on the length of the input array

	If the length of my input array is a power of 2, then we can just multiply it by 2 and subtract 1

	Else I will get the next power of 2 and do the same thing as above

	-------

	void constructTree(int[] input, int[] segTree, int low, int high, int pos) {
		if (low == high) {
			segTree[pos] = input[low];
			return;
		}
		int mid = (low + high) / 2;
		constructTree(input, segTree, low, mid, 2 * pos + 1);
		constructTree(input, segTree, mid + 1, high, 2 * pos + 2);
		segTree[pos] = min(segTree[2 * pos + 1], segTree[2 * pos + 2]);
	}

How to perform a range query in the segment tree:
	
	qLow -> left range of our query
	qHigh -> right range of our query

	int rangeMinQuery(int[] segTree, int qLow, int qHigh, int low, int high, int pos) {
		// totally overlaps condition
		if (qLow <= low && qHigh >= high) {
			return segTree[pos]
		}
		// no overlap condition
		if (qLow > high || qHigh < low) {
			return MAX_VALUE;
		}
		int mid = (low + high) / 2;
		return min(rangeMinQuery(segTree, qLow, qHigh, low, mid, 2 * pos + 1),
					rangeMinQuery(SegTree, qLow, qHigh, mid + 1, high, 2 * pos + 2));
	}
