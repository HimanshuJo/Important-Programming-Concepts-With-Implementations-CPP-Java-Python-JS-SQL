You have four ways of accessing a specific item in a vector:

	Using the [] operator

	Using the member function at(...)

	Using an iterator in combination with a given offset

	Using std::for_each from the algorithm header of the standard C++ library. This is another way which I can recommend (it uses internally an iterator)

-------

static const int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

std::vector<int> v(arr, arr + sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]));

-------

This creates a vector as seen below:

	1 2 3 4

First let's look at the [] way of doing things. 

	It works in pretty much the same way as you expect when working with a normal array. 

	You give an index and possibly you access the item you want. 

		I say possibly because the [] operator doesn't check whether the vector actually has that many items. 

		This leads to a silent invalid memory access. 

		Example:

			v[10] = 9;

-------

A much better way is to use at(...)

	This will automatically check for out of bounds behavior and break throwing an std::out_of_range. 
	So in the case when we have

		v.at(10) = 9;

		We will get:

		    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
		    what(): vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 10) >= this->size() (which is 4)

-------

The third way is similar to the [] operator in the sense you can screw things up. 

A vector just like an array is a sequence of continuous memory blocks containing data of the same type. 

This means that you can use your 'starting address' by assigning it to an iterator and then just 
	add an offset to this iterator. 

	The offset simply stands for how many items after the first item you want to traverse:

		std::vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); // First element of your vector

		*(it+0) = 9;  // offset = 0 basically means accessing v.begin()

		// Now we have 9 2 3 4 instead of 1 2 3 4

		*(it+1) = -1; // offset = 1 means first item of v plus an additional one
		
		// Now we have 9 -1 3 4 instead of 9 2 3 4
