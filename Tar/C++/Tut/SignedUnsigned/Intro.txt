Unsigned Integers:

	Can hold a larger positive value and no negative value.

	There are different ways of representing signed integers. 

		The easiest to visualize is to use the leftmost bit as a flag (sign and magnitude), 
			but more common is two's complement. 

		Both are in use in most modern microprocessors â€” floating point uses sign and magnitude, 
			while integer arithmetic uses two's complement.

	In a 8-bit number system:

		It consists of only non-negative values i.e 0 to 255.

	In a 32-bit number system:

		An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a non-negative integer in the range [0 - 4294967295]

-------

Signed Integers:

	can hold both positive and negative numbers.

	In a 8-bit number system:

		It consists of both negative and positive values but in different formats like

			0 to +127

			-1 to -128

	In a 32-bit number system:

		A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]

		The signed integer is represented in two's complement notation.

			The most significant byte is 0 and the lest significant byte is 3
