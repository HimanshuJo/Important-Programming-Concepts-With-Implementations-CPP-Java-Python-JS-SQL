The three classes that deal with file handling are:

	basic_ifstream

	basic_ofstream

	basic_fstream

ifstream, ofstream and fstream are "char" template specializations which means 
they are nothing but basic_ifstream<char>, basic_ofstream<char> and basic_fstream<char> 
i.e. they deal with reading and writing chars from a file.

ifstream is input file stream which allows you to read the contents of a file.

ofstream is output file stream which allows you to write contents to a file.

fstream allows both reading from and writing to files by default. However, you can have an fstream behave like an ifstream or ofstream by passing in the ios::open_mode flag.

-------

ios::openmode Flags

	The open mode flags are:

	Flag			Description
	ios::app		All write operations must occur at the end of the file
	ios::binary		Open in binary mode
	ios::in			Open for reading
	ios::out		Open for writing
	ios::trunc		Empty the contents of the file after opening
	ios::ate		Go to the end of the file after opening
          
	These flags are additive which means you can combine multiple flags using the bitwise OR | operator. 

	If I want to open the file in binary mode and append, I can combine the flags as follows:

		ios::binary | ios::app

-------

ifstream always has the ios::in flag set and it cannot be removed. 
Similary, ofstream always has the ios::out flag set and it cannot be removed. 
Any other flags added will be combined with ios::in for ifstream and ios::out for ofstream

On the other hand, if you do not pass any flags to fstream, the default is ios::in | ios::out, 
so you can read from as well as write to the file. 
But if you specify a flag explicitly for fstream like ios::in, it will be opened only for reading, like an ifstream.

-------

How to pass flags?

You can do so in the constructor or when calling open():

	//Open the file for reading in binary mode, ios::in will always be set
	ifstream infile("filepath", ios::binary);
	
	// Open the file for writing and clear its contents, ios::out is implicitly set
	ofstream outfile("filepath", ios::trunc);

	// default flag will be: ios::in | ios::out hence both reads and writes possible
	fstream inoutfile("filepath")

	// file will be opened in read mode like fstream
	fstream infile("filepath", ios::in)

	It is basically possible to never use ifstream and ofstream and always use fstream with the required flags. 
	But it is prone to accidental errors while setting the flags. 

	Hence, using ifstream you can be sure that writes will never occur and with ofstream only writes will take place.
