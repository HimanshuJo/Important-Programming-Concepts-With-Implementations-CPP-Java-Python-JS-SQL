String find is used to find the first occurrence of sub-string in the 
specified string being called upon. 

It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string from 
given starting position. 

The default value of starting position is 0.

-------

Function Template:

    size_t find (const string& str, size_t pos = 0);
    size_t find (const char* s, size_t pos = 0);

Function parameters:

    str : The sub-string to be searched.
    s : The sub-string to be searched, given as C style string.
    pos : The initial position from where the string search is to begin.

-------

Function Return:

    The function returns the index of the first occurrence of sub-string, 
        if the sub-string is not found 
        it returns string::npos(string::pos is static member with value as the highest 
        possible for the size_t data structure).

// CPP program to demonstrate working of string
// find to search a string
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string str = "geeksforgeeks a computer science";
	string str1 = "geeks";

	// Find first occurrence of "geeks"
	size_t found = str.find(str1);
	if (found != string::npos)
		cout << "First occurrence is " << found << endl;

	// Find next occurrence of "geeks". Note here we pass
	// "geeks" as C style string.
	char arr[] = "geeks";
	found = str.find(arr, found+1);
	if (found != string::npos)
		cout << "Next occurrence is " << found << endl;

	return 0;
}

Output:
First occurrence is 0
Next occurrence is 8

-------

We can also use it to find occurrence of a character:
In below syntax, note that c is a character.

    size_t find (const char c, size_t pos = 0);

-------

// CPP program to demonstrate working of string
// find to search a string
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string str = "geeksforgeeks a computer science";
	char c = 'g';

	// Find first occurrence of 'g'
	size_t found = str.find(c);
	if (found != string::npos)
		cout << "First occurrence is " << found << endl;

	// Find next occurrence of 'g'
	found = str.find(c, found+1);
	if (found != string::npos)
		cout << "Next occurrence is " << found << endl;

	return 0;
}

Output:
First occurrence is 0
Next occurrence is 8

-------

We can also search for a partial string
In below syntax, note that n is number of characters to match.

    size_t find (const char *str, size_t pos, size_t n);

-------

// CPP program to demonstrate working of string
// find to search a string
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string str = "geeksforgeeks a computer science";

	// Only search first 5 characters of "geeks.practice"
	size_t found = str.find("geeks.practice", 0, 5);
	if (found != string::npos)
		cout << found << endl;

	return 0;
}

Output:
0

-------

// Find all occurrences of a string in a larger string

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

vector<int> allOccurrences(string str){
	size_t found=0;
	int cnt=0;
  	vector<int>res;  
	while(found!=string::npos){
    	found=str.find("geeks", found+cnt++);
	    if(found==string::npos) break;
	  	res.push_back(found);
  	}
	return res;
}

int main(){
    string str="geeksforgeeks a computer science geeks for geeks";
    vector<int>res=allOccurrences(str);
    for(auto &vals: res)
        cout<<vals<<" ";
}

Output: 0 8 33 43
