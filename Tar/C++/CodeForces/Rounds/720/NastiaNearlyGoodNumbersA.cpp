Nastia and Nearly Good Numbers

Nastia has 2 positive integers A and B

She defines that:

    The integer is good if it is divisible by Aâ‹…B

    Otherwise, the integer is nearly good, if it is divisible by A

For example, if A=6 and B=4, the integers 24 and 72 are good, the integers 6, 660 and 12 
are nearly good, the integers 16, 7 are neither good nor nearly good.

Find 3 different positive integers x, y, and z such that exactly one of them is good and 
the other 2 are nearly good, and x+y=z.

Input

5 3
13 2

Output

YES
10 50 60
YES

Good -> divisible by A.B

Nearly Good -> divisible by A

We need to find x, y, y

    such that one of them is good and the other two are nearly good, and
        x + y = z

-------

Let's suppose 
    the first number divisible by A is:
        mA,

    and the other number divisible by A is:
        nA

    the number disivible by A.B is:
        oAB

    If we look at the above three numbers, one thing we can notice is that
        among mA, nA and oAB
            oAB is the largest number

    Therefore we can assign:
        oAB as z
        nA as y
        mA as x

    -------

    From the above equation we get that:
        mA + nA = oAB

        this is basically
            A(m + n) = oAB

            => m + n = oB

    As we don't have to optimize the values, therefore let's assume that
        o = 1

        therefore 
            m + n = B

        let's assume
            m = 1

        therefore
            1 + n = B

        Hence
            n = B - 1
    
    Finally our values are:
        m -> 1
        n -> B - 1
        o -> 1

    -------

    Ans = A + (B - 1)A = AB

    -------

    Some edge cases we have to take into account:
        what if B = 1

        there is no way for B = 1 we can find a solution

        -------

        what is B = 2

            our ans in that case will be:
                A + 3A = 4A
