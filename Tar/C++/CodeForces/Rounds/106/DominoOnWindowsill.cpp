/*

You have a board represented as a grid with 2×n cells.

The first k1 cells on the first row and first k2 cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black.

You have w white dominoes (2×1 tiles, both cells are colored in white) and b black dominoes (2×1 tiles, both cells are colored in black).

You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. 
In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino.

Can you place all w+b dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?
