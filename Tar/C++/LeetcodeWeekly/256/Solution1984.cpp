//  Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores
/*
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the 
score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference 
between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
