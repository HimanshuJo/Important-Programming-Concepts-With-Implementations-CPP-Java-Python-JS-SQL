// 1850. Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number
/*
You are given a string num, representing a large integer, and an integer k.

We call some integer wonderful if it is a permutation of the digits in num and is greater in value than num.
There can be many wonderful integers. However, we only care about the smallest-valued ones.

    For example, when num = "5489355142":
        The 1st smallest wonderful integer is "5489355214".
        The 2nd smallest wonderful integer is "5489355241".
        The 3rd smallest wonderful integer is "5489355412".
        The 4th smallest wonderful integer is "5489355421".

Return the minimum number of adjacent digit swaps that needs to be applied to num to
reach the kth smallest wonderful integer.

The tests are generated in such a way that kth smallest wonderful integer exists.

Example 1:

Input: num = "5489355142", k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The 4th smallest wonderful number is "5489355421". To get this number:
- Swap index 7 with index 8: "5489355142" -> "5489355412"
- Swap index 8 with index 9: "5489355412" -> "5489355421"

Example 2:

Input: num = "11112", k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4th smallest wonderful number is "21111". To get this number:
- Swap index 3 with index 4: "11112" -> "11121"
- Swap index 2 with index 3: "11121" -> "11211"
- Swap index 1 with index 2: "11211" -> "12111"
- Swap index 0 with index 1: "12111" -> "21111"

Example 3:

Input: num = "00123", k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The 1st smallest wonderful number is "00132". To get this number:
- Swap index 3 with index 4: "00123" -> "00132"
 

Constraints:

2 <= num.length <= 1000
1 <= k <= 1000
num only consists of digits.

/*
    To find the next permutation

        suppose we have a number 54586

            we initially start from the end and we find the first index of the number who is
                smaller than the number next to it

                e.g. in the above case that first number is 5 which is smaller than 8
                    let's say firstIdx=2

                That's the place where we want to place a bigger number

            next step is to find the first number scanning from the end that is greater than the number
                which we have just found

                in this case we will find number 6
                    let's say secondIdx=4

                then we swap those two numbers

            after swapping we just have to reverse the numbers after the swapped index as we know
                all the numbers after the swapped index will be in decreasing order

                    i.e reversing the number after firstIdx

                    in this case, the end number will be: 54658

/*

CATCH : JUST FIND THE MIN NUMBER OF STEPS TO MAKE ABOVE TWO STRINGS EQUAL ðŸ‘€

Iterate and reach to a point when the character don't match, 
See below i is pointing at '1' in string1 and 
          j is pointing at '4' in string2 

          because s1[i] != s2[j]

string1 : 5489355142
string2 : 5489355421

Then we do j++ in string2 till we find a matching number in string2 same as the number in string1 which i is pointing currently, 
which brings j to '1' in string2 as 5489355421

Now we will swap from j to i and get following results,

string2 curently: 5489355421

5489355421 ----(swap 1 with 2)----> 5489355412
5489355412 ----(swap 1 with 4)----> 5489355142 (same as string1)

i == j ? STOP

Do the same for rest of the string. No of swaps = No of steps required to make them equal.
