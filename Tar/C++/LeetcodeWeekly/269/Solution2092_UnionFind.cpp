/*
Find All People With Secret
You are given an integer n indicating there are n people numbered from 0 to n - 1. 
You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a meeting at timei.
A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.

Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a
person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 4:

Input: n = 6, meetings = [[0,2,1],[1,3,1],[4,5,1]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 1, person 0 shares the secret with person 2, and person 1 shares the secret with person 3.
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.
