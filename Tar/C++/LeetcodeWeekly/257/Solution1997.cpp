// First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms
/*
There are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each day is labeled, starting from 0. You will go in and visit one room a day.

Initially on day 0, you visit room 0. The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n:

Assuming that on a day, you visit room i,
if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit the room specified by nextVisit[i] where 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i;
if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n.
Return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 3:

Input: nextVisit = [0,1,2,0]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Your room visiting order for each day is: [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,...].
Day 6 is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.

/*
Note 1: To the pass any index i the number of visits must become even
If the number of visits are odd you will end up going a index j = nextVisit[i] with 0 <= j <= i (Since 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i)

Assume days[i] = number of days required to pass i if you visit index i for the fist time

Note 2 If you visited i for the first time, it would always be an odd visit, and you will have to go to nextVisit[i].

Now let j = nextVisit[i]

Case 1
If j == i then you will again reach i and number of visits will become even and you can move to i+1. Thus, days[i] = 2

Case 2
If j < i, then this visit to j will always be odd one (Because you have already passed j earlier and thus number of visits must have become even).
Thus, to calculate days[i] = number of days required to pass i, you need to first pass j, then you will reach j+1, and now you have to pass j+1, then you reach j+2 and so on. And then you will finally arrive at i and this time number of visits will be even and thus you can go to i+1.
Thus = days[i] = 2 + days[j] + days[j+1] + days[j+2] + ... + days[i-1]
2 becaue you also arrive at i 2 times.
But note that doing this naively will cause TLE thus you can use prefix sum approach to optimize the solution.

/*
Let dp[i] be the number of days needed to jump from room 0 to room i. The answer is dp[N - 1].

For dp[i], on top of the days needed for reaching room i-1, i.e. dp[i-1], we need these extra days to go from room i-1 to room i.

If A[i-1] == i-1, we just need 2 days
Otherwise, we need to jump to room A[i-1] first, taking 1 day. Then spent dp[i-1] - dp[A[i-1]] days to go from room A[i-1] to room i-1 again. Lastly, take 1 day to go from room i-1 to room i. So in total, we need extra 2 + dp[i-1] - dp[A[i-1]] days.
