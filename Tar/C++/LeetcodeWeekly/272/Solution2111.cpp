// 2111. Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing
/*
You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.

The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.

For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:
arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)
However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).
In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.
