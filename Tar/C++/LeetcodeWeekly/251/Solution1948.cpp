// Delete Duplicate Folders in System

/*
Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths, 
where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.

For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty 
set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be 
at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as 
well as all their subfolders.

For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical. 
They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
/a
/a/x
/a/x/y
/a/z
/b
/b/x
/b/x/y
/b/z
However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders "/a" and "/b" 
would not be identical. Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still be considered identical even 
with the added folder.
Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will 
delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become 
identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.

Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all 
the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.

Examples:

Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
Output: [["d"],["d","a"]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named "b".

Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
Output: [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown. 
Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because 
they both contain an empty folder named "y".
Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they are not 
deleted because they were not marked beforehand.

Input: paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
Output: [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.

Input: paths = [["a"],["a","x"],["a","x","y"],["a","z"],["b"],["b","x"],["b","x","y"],["b","z"]]
Output: []
Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an
empty folder named "y".
Folders "/a" and "/b" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder "z" and the folder "x" described above.

Input: paths = [["a"],["a","x"],["a","x","y"],["a","z"],["b"],["b","x"],["b","x","y"],["b","z"],["b","w"]]
Output: [["b"],["b","w"],["b","z"],["a"],["a","z"]]
Explanation: This has the same structure as the previous example, except with the added "/b/w".
Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" are still marked, but "/a" and "/b" are no longer marked because "/b" has the
empty folder named "w" and "/a" does not.
Note that "/a/z" and "/b/z" are not marked because the set of identical subfolders must 
be non-empty, but these folders are empty.

Constraints:

1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= paths[i].length <= 500
1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10
1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 105
path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
No two paths lead to the same folder.
For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.

Solution 1. DFS
Build Tree: Build a folder tree based on the paths. The process is similar to the Trie building process.
Dedupe: Use post-order traversal to visit all the nodes. If we've seen the subfolder structure 
before, mark the node as deleted.
Generate Paths: DFS to generate the output. We skip the nodes that have been deleted.
Update 1: To ensure we visit the subfolders in the same order, 
changed Node::next to unordered_map to map. (Testcase: [["a"],["a","a"],["a","b"],["a","b","a"],["b"],["b","a"],["b","a","a"],["b","b"]]. Thanks @wshack)

Update 2: To ensure the subfolder structure string only map to a unique tree structure,
changed the encoding to use parenthesis instead, e.g. (root(firstChild)(secondChild)...). 
(Testcase: [["r","x"],["r","x", "b"],["r","x","b","a"],["r", "y"],["r","y", "a"],["r","y", "b"],["r"]]. 

Complexity Analysis

Assume N is the number of folders, W is the maximum length of folder name, D is the deepest 
folder depth, and C is the maximum number of direct child folders.

Build Tree: 

    We need to add all the N folders, each of which takes O(DWlogC) time. 
    So overall it takes O(NDWlogC) time, and O(NW) space.

Dedupe: 

    We traverse the N folders in post-order. 
    The maximum length of subfolder structure string is roughly O(NW), 
    so each node visit need O(NW) time to check if it's a duplicate. 
    The overall time complexity is O(N^2 * W) and the space complexity is O(N^2 * W).

Generate Paths: 

    In the worst case we traverse the N nodes again. 
    Each visit takes O(W) time to update the current path and O(DW) time to update the answer. 
    So overall the time complexity is O(NDW) and space complexity is O(DW) for the temporary path.
