// Maximum Compatibility Score Sum

// Backtracking
/*
There is a survey that consists of n questions where each question's answer is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).

The survey was given to m students numbered from 0 to m - 1 and m mentors numbered from 0 to m - 1. 
The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array students where students[i] is an integer array that 
contains the answers of the ith student (0-indexed). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array 
mentors where mentors[j] is an integer array that contains the answers of the jth mentor (0-indexed).

Each student will be assigned to one mentor, and each mentor will have one student assigned to them. 
The compatibility score of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.

For example, if the student's answers were [1, 0, 1] and the mentor's answers were [0, 0, 1], then 
their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.
You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to maximize the sum of the compatibility scores.

Given students and mentors, return the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved.

Example 1:

Input: students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]], mentors = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 8
Explanation: We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

/*
The brute force solution is generating all the permuntations of the mentors and calculate the score of this permutation and the students.

The permutation generation process with DFS takes O(M! * M) time and calculating the score takes O(N) time, so the overall time complexity is O(M! * MN).

Since M and N are at most 8 and 8! * 8^2 = 2,580,480 ~= 2.6e6, such solution should be able to pass.
