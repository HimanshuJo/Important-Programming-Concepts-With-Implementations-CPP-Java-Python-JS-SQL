What's an inode?

	Inodes, speculated to be short for “index nodes,” 

	An inode is a file data structure that stores information about any 
		Linux file except its name and data.

	What are inodes used for?

		Data is stored on your disk in the form of fixed-size blocks. If you save a file that exceeds a standard block, your computer will find the next available segment on which to store the rest of your file. Over time, that can get super confusing.

		That’s where inodes come in. While they don’t contain any of the file’s actual data, it stores the file’s metadata, including all the storage blocks on which the file’s data can be found. 

		Information contained in an inode:

			File size
			Device on which the file is stored 
			User and group IDs associated with the file
			Permissions needed to access the file
			Creation, read, and write timestamps
			Location of the data (though not the filepath)
			Inodes are also independent of filenames. That means you can copy a single file, rename it, and still have it point to the same inode as the original.

What's the angle between clock hands when it's 3:15?

-------

Write a C function that returns angle between clock hands for any (hour, minute).

	/*
	The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minute(or 6 degrees in one minute) and hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours(or 0.5 degrees in 1 minute). In h hours and m minutes, the minute hand would move (h*60 + m)*6 and hour hand would move (h*60 + m)*0.5.
	*/
	// C program to find angle between hour and minute hands
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>

	// Utility function to find minimum of two integers
	int min(int x, int y) { return (x < y)? x: y; }

	int calcAngle(double h, double m)
	{
		// validate the input
		if (h <0 || m < 0 || h >12 || m > 60)
			printf("Wrong input");

		if (h == 12) h = 0;
		if (m == 60)
		{
			m = 0;
			h += 1;
			if(h>12) h = h-12;
		}


		// Calculate the angles moved by hour and minute hands
		// with reference to 12:00
		int hour_angle = 0.5 * (h*60 + m);
		int minute_angle = 6*m;

		// Find the difference between two angles
		int angle = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle);

		// Return the smaller angle of two possible angles
		angle = min(360-angle, angle);

		return angle;
	}

	// Driver Code
	int main()
	{
		printf("%d n", calcAngle(9, 60));
		printf("%d n", calcAngle(3, 30));
		return 0;
	}
