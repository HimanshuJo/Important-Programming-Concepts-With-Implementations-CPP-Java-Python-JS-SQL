//Count Distinct Subsequences

/*Given a string, find the count of distinct subsequences of it. 

Examples: 

Input  : str = "gfg"
Output : 7
The seven distinct subsequences are "", "g", "f",
"gf", "fg", "gg" and "gfg" 

Input  : str = "ggg"
Output : 4
The four distinct subsequences are "", "g", "gg"
and "ggg"

The problem of counting distinct subsequences is easy if all characters of 
input string are distinct. The count is equal to nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + … nCn = 2n.
How to count distinct subsequences when there can be repetition in input string? 
A Simple Solution to count distinct subsequences in a string with duplicates 
is to generate all subsequences. For every subsequence, store it in a hash 
table if it doesn’t exist already. The time complexity of this solution is 
exponential and it requires exponential extra space.

Method 1(Naive Approach): Using a set (without Dynamic Programming)

Approach: Generate all the possible subsequences of a given string. 
The subsequences of a string can be generated in the following manner: 
a) Include a particular element(say ith) in the output array and 
recursively call the function for the rest of the input string. 
This results in the subsequences of a string having ith character.

b) Exclude a particular element(say ith) and recursively call the 
function for the rest of the input string. This contains all the 
subsequences which don’t have the ith character.
Once we have generated a subsequence, in the base case of the function 
we insert that generated subsequence in an unordered set. 
An unordered Set is a Data structure, that stores distinct elements 
in an unordered manner. This way we insert all the generated subsequences 
in the set and print the size of the set as our answer because at last, 
the set will contain only distinct subsequences.

Method 2(Efficient Approach): Using Dynamic Programming

An Efficient Solution doesn’t require the generation of subsequences.  

Let countSub(n) be count of subsequences of 
first n characters in input string. We can
recursively write it as below. 

countSub(n) = 2*Count(n-1) - Repetition

If current character, i.e., str[n-1] of str has
not appeared before, then 
   Repetition = 0

Else:
   Repetition  =  Count(m)
   Here m is index of previous occurrence of
   current character. We basically remove all
   counts ending with previous occurrence of
   current character.

How does this work? 
If there are no repetitions, then count becomes double of count for n-1 
because we get count(n-1) more subsequences by adding current character 
at the end of all subsequences possible with n-1 length.

If there are repetitions, then we find a count of all distinct subsequences 
ending with the previous occurrence. This count can be obtained by 
recursively calling for an index of the previous occurrence. 
Since the above recurrence has overlapping subproblems, we can solve 
it using Dynamic Programming. 

Below is the implementation of the above idea.

// C++ program to count number of distinct
// subsequences of a given string.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_CHAR = 256;

const int maxx=1000;

// Returns count of distinct sunsequences of str.
int countSub(string str)
{
	// Create an array to store index
	// of last
	vector<int> last(MAX_CHAR, -1);

	// Length of input string
	int n = str.length();

	// dp[i] is going to store count of distinct
	// subsequences of length i.
	int dp[maxx + 1];

	// Empty substring has only one subsequence
	dp[0] = 1;

	// Traverse through all lengths from 1 to n.
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		// Number of subsequences with substring
		// str[0..i-1]
		dp[i] = 2 * dp[i - 1];

		// If current character has appeared
		// before, then remove all subsequences
		// ending with previous occurrence.
		if (last[str[i - 1]] != -1)
			dp[i] = dp[i] - dp[last[str[i - 1]]];

		// Mark occurrence of current character
		last[str[i - 1]] = (i - 1);
	}
	return dp[n];
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	cout << countSub("gfg");
	return 0;
}
