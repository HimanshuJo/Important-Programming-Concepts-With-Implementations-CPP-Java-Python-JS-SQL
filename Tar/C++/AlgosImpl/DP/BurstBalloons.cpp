//312. Burst Balloons
/*
You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it 
represented by an array nums.
You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. 
If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array,
then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

for (int k = left; k <= right; ++k)
	dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], 
	                      nums[left-1] * nums[k] * nums[right+1] + 
	                      dp[left][k-1] + dp[k+1][right])**

First of all, dp[i][j] in here means, the maximum coins we get after we burst all 
the balloons between i and j in the original array.

For example with input [3,1,5,8] :

dp[0][0] means we burst ballons between [0,0], which means we only burst the first balloon 
in original array. 
So dp[0][0] is 1 * 3 * 1 = 3.

dp[1][1] means we burst balloons between [1][1], which means we only burst the second ballon in 
the original array. 
So dp[1][1] is 3 * 1 * 5 = 15.

So in the end for this problem we want to find out dp[0][ arr.length - 1 ], which is the 
maximum value we can get 
when we burst all the balloon between [0, length -1]

To get that we need the transition function :

for (int k = left; k <= right; ++k)
dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], 
                      nums[left-1] * nums[k] * nums[right+1] + dp[left][k-1] + dp[k+1][right])

This transition function basically says in order to get the maximum value we can get for 
bursting all the balloons 
between [i , j] , we just loop through each balloon between these two indexes and make them to 
be the last balloon to be burst,

why we pick it as the last balloon to burst ?

For example when calculating dp[0,3] and picking index 2 as the last balloon to burst,

[3 , 1 , 5 , 8] , that means 5 is the last balloon to burst between [0,3] , to get 
the maximum value when picking 
5 as the last balloon to burst :

max = maximum value of bursting all the balloon on the left side of 5 + maximum value of 
bursting all the balloon 
on the right side of 5 + bursting balloon 5 when left side and right side are gone.

That is dp[0, 1] + nums[0 - 1] * nums[2] * nums[3 + 1] + dp[3,3];

That is dp[left, k - 1] + nums[left - 1] * nums[k] * nums[right + 1] + dp[k+1, right] ;
