Given two arrays arr[] and brr[] containing integers. 
The task is to find the Kth largest product of a pair (arr[i], brr[j]).

Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 3}, brr[] = {3, -4, 0}, K = 3
Output: 3
Explaination: All product combinations in descending order are : [9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, -4, -6, -12] and 
3rd largest element is 3.

Input: arr[] = {-1, -5, -3}, brr[] = {-3, -4, 0}, K =5
Output: 4
Explaination: All product combinations in descending order are : [20, 15, 12, 9, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0] and 
5th largest element is 4.
*/

/*
Naive Approach: Generate all the possible products combination for each element in array arr[] with 
each element in array brr[]. Then sort the array of results and return the Kth element of the results array.

Time Complexity: O(N*M + (N+M) * Log(N+M))
Auxiliary Space: O(N+M)
*/

/*
Efficient Approach: This problem can be solved by using the Greedy Approach and Heaps. 

Sort the brr[] array.
Keep larger size array in the array arr[]. 
Create a max heap to store the elements with their respective indices.
Traverse each element from array arr[]. The element can be either positive or negative.
Positive:
	Multiply current element from arr[] with the largest element of sorted array brr[]. 
	To ensure that maximum element is obtained.
Negative:
	In this case multiply with the smallest value, i.e. with the first element from array brr[]. 
	This is due to the property of negation, as a larger value can be obtained by multiplying with the 
	smallest one.
Insert three values into heap such that : (product, i, j) where i & j are the indices of arrays arr[] and brr[]. 
Now run a for loop K times and pop elements from the heap.
Now check if the value present at arr[i] is positive or negative
Positive:
	So next_j = (current_jâ€“1) because as max heap is been used, all the higher indices might have 
	been already popped from the heap.
Negative:
	next_j = (current_j+1) because all the smaller values yielding larger elements might have been 
	already popped from the heap.
Finally, return the answer
Note:  Max heap is implemented with the help of min-heap, by negating the signs of the 
       values while inserting them into the heap in Python.
