// Number of possible Triangles in a Cartesian coordinate system
/*
Given n points in a Cartesian coordinate system. Count the number of triangles formed.

Examples:
Input  : point[] = {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 2)
Output : 3
Three triangles can be formed from above points.

A simple solution is to check if the determinant of the three points selected is non-zero or not. T
he following determinant gives the area of a Triangle (Also known as Cramerâ€™s rule).
Area of the triangle with corners at (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) is given by:

{ Area = \pm \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} x1 & y1 & 1\\ x2 & y2 & 1\\ x3 & y3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}}

We can solve this by taking all possible combination of 3 points and finding the determinant
*/

/*
Efficient Approach: Consider a point Z and find its slope with every other point.
Now, if two points are having the same slope with point Z that means the 3 points are collinear
and they cannot form a triangle. Hence, the number of triangles having Z as one of its points is the number of
ways of choosing 2 points from the remaining points and then subtracting the number of ways of choosing 2 points
from points having the same slope with Z. Since Z can be any point among N points, we have to iterate one more loop.
