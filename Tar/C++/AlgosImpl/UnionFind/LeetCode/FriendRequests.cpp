// 2076. Process Restricted Friend Requests
/*
You are given an integer n indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array restrictions, where restrictions[i] = [xi, yi] means that person xi and 
person yi cannot become friends, either directly or indirectly through other people.

Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a 0-indexed 2D integer array requests, 
where requests[j] = [uj, vj] is a friend request between person uj and person vj.

A friend request is successful if uj and vj can be friends. Each friend request is processed in the given order 
(i.e., requests[j] occurs before requests[j + 1]), and upon a successful request, uj and vj become direct friends for all future friend requests.

Return a boolean array result, where each result[j] is true if the jth friend request is successful or false if it is not.

Note: If uj and vj are already direct friends, the request is still successful.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[0,2],[2,1]]
Output: [true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 0 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends. 
Request 1: Person 2 and person 1 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (1--2--0).

Example 3:

Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], requests = [[0,4],[1,2],[3,1],[3,4]]
Output: [true,false,true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 0 and person 4 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 1: Person 1 and person 2 cannot be friends since they are directly restricted.
Request 2: Person 3 and person 1 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 3: Person 3 and person 4 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--4--3--1).
